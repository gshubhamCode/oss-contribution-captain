The endpoint should verify availability, create an escrow using Trustless Work, and store the reservation in Supabase, following best practices for data validation, blockchain integration, and error handling.\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0️ Technical Stack\n- **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js\n- **Database**: Supabase\n- **Blockchain**: Stellar (Soroban for availability verification, Trustless Work for escrow)\n- **Authentication**: JWT\n- **Validation**: Zod\n- **Types**: TypeScript\n- **Testing**: Jest\n- **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Technical Tasks\n\n### Database Schema\n- [ ] Create `bookings` table in Supabase:\n```sql\ncreate table public.bookings (\n  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,\n  property_id uuid references public.properties(id) not null,\n  user_id uuid references public.users(id) not null,\n  dates jsonb not null, -- { from: \"YYYY-MM-DD\", to: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" }\n  guests integer not null,\n  total decimal(10,2) not null, -- Total cost (nights × price + deposit)\n  deposit decimal(10,2) not null, -- Security deposit\n  escrow_address text not null, -- Stellar address for escrow\n  status text not null default 'pending', -- pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed\n  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,\n  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,\n  constraint status_values check (status in ('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed')),\n  constraint guests_check check (guests > 0),\n  constraint total_check check (total > 0),\n  constraint deposit_check check (deposit >= 0)\n);\n```\n\n### Type definitions\nCreate apps/backend/src/types/booking.types.ts:\n```sql\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n\nexport interface Booking {\n  id: string; // UUID generated by Supabase\n  propertyId: string; // References properties.id\n  userId: string; // References users.id\n  dates: { from: Date; to: Date }; // Reservation dates\n  guests: number; // Number of guests\n  total: number; // Total cost in USDC (nights × price + deposit)\n  deposit: number; // Security deposit in USDC\n  escrowAddress: string; // Stellar escrow address from Trustless Work\n  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled' | 'completed'; // Booking status\n  createdAt: Date; // Automatically managed by Supabase\n  updatedAt: Date; // Automatically managed by Supabase\n}\n\nexport const createBookingSchema = z.object({\n  propertyId: z.string().uuid('Invalid property ID'),\n  userId: z.string().uuid('Invalid user ID'),\n  dates: z.object({\n    from: z.date().refine((date) => date >= new Date(), { message: 'The start date must be in the future' }),\n    to: z.date()\n  }).refine((data) => data.to > data.from, { message: 'The end date must be later than the start date' }),\n  guests: z.number().int('Guests must be an integer').positive('Guests must be positive'),\n  total: z.number().positive('Total cost must be positive'),\n  deposit: z.number().nonnegative('Deposit must be non-negative')\n});\n\nexport type CreateBookingInput = z.infer<typeof createBookingSchema>;\n```\n### Service Layer\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/services/booking.service.ts`:\n  - Implement `createBooking` function to validate availability using Soroban `BookingContract`, create escrow with Trustless Work, and store the reservation in Supabase.\n  - Add error handling for blockchain and database operations.\n  - Add TypeScript types for all operations.\n\n### Controller Layer\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/controllers/booking.controller.ts`:\n  - Implement input validation with Zod.\n  - Handle service responses.\n  - Format error messages.\n  - Add proper status codes (201 for success, 400 for validation errors, etc.).\n\n### Routes\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/routes/booking.routes.ts`:\n  - Set up the booking route for `POST /api/bookings`.\n  - Apply authentication middleware (JWT).\n  - Apply validation middleware (Zod).\n  - Configure error handling.\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/tests/booking.test.ts`:\n  - Test successful booking creation.\n  - Test authentication failures (missing/invalid token).\n  - Test validation errors (invalid dates, guests, etc.).\n  - Test availability conflicts (using Soroban).\n  - Test escrow creation failures (using Trustless Work).\n  - Test database errors.\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Authentication\n- [ ] Endpoint requires a valid JWT token.\n- [ ] Token must be provided in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` format.\n- [ ] Invalid or missing tokens return 401 with a clear error message.\n\n### Input Validation\n- [ ] All required fields (`propertyId`, `userId`, `dates`, `guests`, `total`, `deposit`) are present and valid.\n- [ ] `propertyId` and `userId` must be valid UUIDs.\n- [ ] `dates.from` must be in the future.\n- [ ] `dates.to` must be later than `dates.from`.\n- [ ] `guests` must be a positive integer.\n- [ ] `total` must be positive.\n- [ ] `deposit` must be non-negative.\n- [ ] Invalid inputs return 400 with validation details.\n\n### Availability Check\n- [ ] Use Soroban `BookingContract` to verify that the requested dates are available for the property.\n- [ ] If dates are unavailable, return 409 with a message: \"Property is not available for the selected dates\".\n\n### Escrow Creation\n- [ ] Use Trustless Work to create an escrow for the payment and deposit.\n- [ ] Store the escrow address in the booking record.\n- [ ] If escrow creation fails, return 500 with a message: \"Failed to create escrow\".\n\n### Response Format\n#### Success (201)\n- A JSON object with a `booking` field containing `bookingId` (e.g., \"book-789\"), `escrowAddress` (e.g., \"GABC...\"), and `status` (e.g., \"pending\").\n\n#### Validation Error (400)\n- A JSON object with an `error` field (\"Validation error\") and a `details` array containing validation errors (e.g., field \"dates.from\" with message \"The start date must be in the future\").\n\n#### Conflict Error (409)\n- A JSON object with an `error` field (\"Property is not available for the selected dates\").\n\n### Error Handling\n- [ ] Authentication errors: 401.\n- [ ] Validation errors: 400.\n- [ ] Availability conflicts: 409.\n- [ ] Escrow or blockchain errors: 500.\n- [ ] Database errors: 500.\n- [ ] All errors include descriptive messages.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDA References\n- [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs)\n- [Stellar Soroban Documentation](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs)\n- [Trustless Work Documentation](https://trustless.work/docs)\n- [Express.js Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)\n- [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction)\n- [Zod Schema Validation](https://zod.dev/)\n\n## \uD83D\uDD04 Dependencies\n- Authentication middleware implemented.\n- Supabase connection configured.\n- Error handling middleware implemented.\n- Soroban `BookingContract` deployed and accessible.\n- Trustless Work integration configured.\n- Properties and users tables in Supabase.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD12 Security Considerations\n- Validate and sanitize all inputs.\n- Ensure proper CORS configuration.\n- Rate limit the endpoint.\n- Log all booking attempts.\n- Validate total and deposit amounts.\n- Secure blockchain interactions with Trustless Work.\n- Implement retry logic for escrow creation.","updatedAt":"2025-06-04T01:13:57Z","user":"respp","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/respp","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82795026?v=4","labels":["Backend","ODHack 14","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["Hi, my name is Ebubechi, a backend dev skilled in Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Supabase, and Stellar.

This can currently only be done by clicking on the tray icon and selecting the layout that should be active.","updatedAt":"2025-05-29T20:10:38Z","user":"arylix","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/arylix","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173406799?v=4","labels":["help wanted","enhancement","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["Hey! Thank you for your suggestion! With this extension my focus is on extending default behavior of GNOME Shell or implement loved features from other OSs. Your idea would be something new, what would be a good default keybinding to select the active layout in your opinion? Of course allowing to customize it from the preferences.","Would SUPER + CTRL + Arrow Left / Arrow Right be a good option?","I suggested this in #36 as well \uD83D\uDE09.\n\nI think it's a great idea to accompany the other keyboard shortcuts which are working great.\n\nI'm not sure what shortcut but something without conflicts would be good. Super + n, super + b?\n\nAway from the computer so not sure if that conflicts.\n\nEdit: if Super + alt is used to span tiles then super + ctrl for this makes sense!","I would also like this feature. \r\n\r\nPerhaps in addition to a keyboard shortcut, would it also be possible to use the scrollwheel while holding a window + CTRL ? So you effectively scroll through the configured layouts.","Thank you guys for your feedback! A quick update for you. I'm going to publish a new update this week and then I'm going to start to work on this :partying_face:\r\n\r\nJust a little mockup for you, feel free to share your thoughts! This feature will behave similarly to ALT+TAB: when the keyboard shortcut is pressed, the layouts are shown and you can cycle through them to select the layout:\r\n![Group 6](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/assets/14203981/44055b6f-64ee-41d6-a7b0-a94512d9c4b0)\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure which default shortcut to choose, but it will be customizable.","This is exactly how I wanted it to be!","Looks good \uD83D\uDE0E","I mentioned in #117 that I'd elaborate on one of my frequent workflows that this would greatly facilitate:\r\n\r\nMy coding layout frequently looks something like this:\r\n```\r\n-------------\r\n|  |   |----|\r\n-------------\r\n```\r\nTwo full-height windows then two half-height windows stacked on top of one another.\r\nThe leftmost window is usually a browser window, the middle my code editor, and the right two are different terminal windows.\r\n\r\nAnother common layout I use (I'm on an ultrawide monitor) is this:\r\n```\r\n-------------\r\n|  |     |  |\r\n-------------\r\n```\r\nThree full-height windows with the center one being larger. I generally have the left two windows the same as above (browser, code editor). Then, the rightmost window is frequently some sort of documentation.\r\n\r\nI frequently switch between these two layouts while working. \r\n","I think this feature would be a great addition as it would eliminate most mouse usage.\r\n\r\nI like the mock-up.\r\n\r\nI suggest `<Super><tab>` as the hot key.  ","I would love this even more now that auto-tiling is a thing! Would complement it nicely imo.","@domferr progress update? it has been ~6 months","Hi @skewty, no progress unfortunately. Believe it or not, but I'm the only developer of Tiling Shell and in the last months I had to make a choice and I had to prioritize other features, I'm sorry. There have been contributions from other developers as well but on other topics.\n\nThis feature is definitely going to be implemented! I believe this is a must have and I hope to prioritize this over other features in the coming releases \uD83C\uDF1F \nMeanwhile, if anyone wants to give it a try, even just contributing to a portion of this feature, the following is a hopefully exhaustive list of things to be done. Feel free to reach me out here or with a new issue if you wanna contribute! Your help would mean A LOT \uD83D\uDC9F \n- Create a widget implementing the mockup above. The sizes could be the same as the ones in ALT+TAB.\n- Listen to a shortcut defined in the settings to show and switch layouts, as in the mockup above. To be more clear, this has to work exactly how ALT+TAB works \uD83D\uDE0E so we can copy the same strategies they use\n- Add a new entry in the preferences' shortcuts to allow users set and unset the shortcut. If the shortcut is set, this feature can be considered enabled, so we don't need to add an enable-disable entry in the preferences too\n- The layout has NOT to be changed globally. The layout has to be changed on the current monitor and current workspace. To switch layout we can follow how I developed the layout switcher behind the indicator icon menu\n- The layout has to be changed when the shortcut is released. For example, if there are 4 layouts, the widget must show which one is the current layout and pressing the shortcut X times would move the selection X times. When moving the selection it is better to don't switch the layout yet, to save resources. The layout can be finally switched when the user has made its decision (e.g. the shortcut is released). To make it more clear, this is exactly the same behaviour we have when pressing ALT+TAB and switching windows\n- Like it works when pressing ALT+TAB, if the user is on the last layout on the right, pressing the shortcut will move the selection to the first layout from the left\n\n_Does it mean that without any contribution this feature will never be implemented?_ No. At some point I will develop it. But any contribution would speed up the process \uD83E\uDD47 ","Hey @domferr has there been any progress on this feature? If not I'd love to find some time to start developing this","Hey @joj0s no progress at all unfortunately! I would love if you could contribute with this feature or just a portion of it!

Copied here as a **mirror**:\r\n\r\nAlready part of https://github.com/diasurgical/scalpel/blob/master/BUGS.md\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details><summary>The DSF Buglist for Diablo v1.09</summary>\r\n\r\nThe intent of this list is not to make Blizzard look bad; in fact, compared to most other computer games out there, Diablo is exceptionally stable and bugless. The intent of this list is to educate and provide insight for anyone wanting to see what parts of the game don't work as intended or are strange. This list was constructed on the Diablo Strategy Forum, from the people who know more about the game than Blizzard itself does. :)\r\n\r\nIf you feel that you know of a reproducible bug that affects gameplay, post about it on the DSF. Find out if it really is a new bug, and I'll get it added.\r\n\r\nHeartfelt thanks and a major thumbs up to all who've contributed bugs or helped explain them so far: Agammaglobulin, Argus McFrugal, Armin, Bolty, Charles Warren, Claudio(Cat), Code Myster, Cyrene, Darkman(BNM), Dark_Slayer, Das Regard, DaveMcW, Dr. Disaster, Dr. Zed, Drasca, El_Gecko, Erthshade, Esau, EviL, felisandria, Flux, Frank, Frenzy, Gorakh, Gyrefalcon, JakRabbit, Jarulf, KingOfPain, Kipo, Lance, Lochnar, M., Mayaheine, mellymel, moe SAINT EverGreen, Mystifier(CB), NoVit4Me, Nystul, Omega, Rand'al, Rich, Ruger, Tahrajj, Thecla, the Sage, Saxywoo, Sourceror, StormDemon, Stu, Tommi Helminen, Uwain, Van Damned, Varaya, and Walkiry.\r\n\r\nUnless stated so, all bugs are multiplayer bugs. Some may apply to single player mode, some may not. Also, a key point here: many of these bugs aren't really bugs, but strange behavior, or quirk, in the game that was probably intentional. The reason they are in this list is because the list is meant to be an educational tool to point out quirks of the game to people who've never heard of them.\r\n\r\nTo date, two immediate game-crashing bugs have been identified in version 1.09.\r\n\r\n# SPELL BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are related to spells and spellcasting.\r\n\r\n## CHARGED BOLT\r\n\r\nIf you stand in a tile of a bookcase or shrine and cast Charged Bolt, the spell effect will be terminated immediately.  No bolts will form, but you will lose mana.\r\n\r\n## FIRE WALL\r\n\r\nFire Walls do more damage than listed in the spell book.\r\n\r\nWhen you walk through a firewall in a way against its alignment, you will not be damaged if you step through its gaps. For instance, walking through a horizontal straight firewall diagonally won't damage you if you walk through at the correct tiles. The same effect applies to monsters and other players.\r\n\r\n## TELEKINESIS\r\n\r\nIf you Telekinesis a monster too much, it's possible for it to disappear into a wall. You will see the graphic in the wall, but no monster.\r\n\r\nYou cannot drink a potion from your belt using number keys while the Telekinesis cursor is active.\r\n\r\nTelekinesis won't work on a monster unless it is activated. These means you can't mess with them if you can only see them with Infravision.\r\n\r\n## TOWN PORTAL\r\n\r\nIf a character goes to pick up an item as he/she is entering a Town Portal, a dupe will appear on the other side, thus creating the same item in town and in the dungeon. Neither item will be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf a character dies while entering a Town Portal he/she will arrive in town dead, being unable to restart in town. The character must be resurrected, or he/she can drink a potion to heal to a living state. Also, if the character was killed by a monster, his/her equipment will fall in town - in a position relative to the level he/she left (sometimes in impossible locations, such as inside buildings).\r\n\r\nCasting a spell just as you enter a Town Portal can cause a casting of the spell in town, producing an Illegal Spell warning.\r\n\r\nOn levels in which \"Gargoyles\" (i.e. Winged Demons, Gargoyles, Blood Claws, and Death Wings) are present, if a player leaves via Town Portal and re-enters the level, upon arrival all Gargoyles' \"stone status\" is not preserved. They'll activate normally, but they'll behave differently had they been in \"stone status.\"\r\n\r\nYou cannot drink a potion from your belt using number keys while the Town Portal cursor is active.\r\n\r\n## FLASH\r\n\r\nIf you stand in the X in the diagram below and cast Flash, monsters in squares 1, 3, and 5 will receive about 1/10 of the normal Flash damage for some weird reason. Conversely, if the MONSTER is in the X, standing in 4, 6, and 8 will limit the damage you will be doing to that monster with flash. This rule also applies for when the monsters are casting Flash.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   1\r\n  2 3\r\n 4 X 5\r\n  6 7\r\n   8\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen casting Flash, your character becomes temporarily invulnerable (but cannot move or take any other action).\r\n\r\n## STONE CURSE\r\n\r\nEnemy mages can be Stone Cursed in mid-teleport, which makes them invisible and invincible until Stone Curse wears off. Golems will even (unsuccessfully) attack mages in this state.\r\n\r\n## FLAME WAVE\r\n\r\nFlame Wave misses every other square when cast in the diagonal, direct left, right, top and bottom screen orientation.\r\n\r\n## FIREBALL\r\n\r\nFireball actually does far more damage than listed in the spell book, as a Fireball hit causes initial damage to the target and then splash damage on top of it.\r\n\r\nSplash damage from Fireballs (possibly other spells) is removed when traveling over objects like spikes, chests, etc. Try casting a Fireball into a pack of Snow Witches behind a spike or something, and only the direct damage will be applied; one witch will be hit, the rest won't be scratched.\r\n\r\n## MANA SHIELD\r\n\r\nAny attack causing more damage than a character's current hit points will not stun the character if they are using Mana Shield. Furthermore, the game considers the character to be in a state of death for a small period of time before his/her hit points are \"refunded\" by the Mana Shield. During this period of death (fraction of a second) the character is actually rendered immune to attacks, and cannot be knocked backward as well.\r\n\r\nPlayers can \"block\" stairways when they enter them. A \"ghost\" image of the character remains at the stair entrance to the other players, and remains until the stair-taking player finishes loading up the next level. This blocking effect occurs 100% of the time when the player has a Mana Shield cast.\r\n\r\nAll spell levels of Mana Shield have the same damage reduction effect, 33%.\r\n\r\nMana Shields only reduce the damage caused by a Constricting Ring by 25%, not 33%.\r\n\r\n## GOLEM\r\n\r\nThe damage listed under the Golem spell in the Spell Book has no meaning. Golems do not do a constant rate of damage; their hit points are controlled by the caster's max mana.\r\n\r\nIf a character steps into a square the Golem was swinging at (to kill a monster) and the Golem hits the character, it then treats the character as an enemy and will attack him.\r\n\r\nIf, while standing adjacent to an enemy, you cast a golem with your cursor on yourself, the golem will appear on your tile. Your golem takes no damage with this bug.\r\n\r\nA Golem has an infinite light radius to anything that uses Succubus, Goat Archer, or Skeleton Archer AI. Any such creature in a line of sight to it will fire at it but will not necessarily be otherwise activated.\r\n\r\nGolems do very minimal damage against witches when the witches are trapped inside a Hell stairwell.\r\n\r\n## SPELL MEMORY CARRYOVER\r\n\r\nUpon starting the Diablo program (before you play any other games of Diablo), start a game; click on the spell speedbook square and press 'S' at the same time. You'll get to use the Null Skill, which does nothing and looks like a fire-based spell.\r\n\r\nIf you use a spell on one character and then switch to a new one who doesn't have that spell, you can use the same technique above to load the old spell on the new character.  If the character doesn't have that spell, it'll show up as a level zero spell.\r\n\r\n## SPELL QUEUING\r\n\r\nYou can queue spells by casting one while another's already being cast, and this can cause lots of problems. Examples are Teleporting only a space or two because the spell queued where your cursor was at the time, casting a spell when you don't have enough mana for it (you get a free cast and end up with negative mana), and firing spells in completely wrong directions because your mouse cursor was moved after the first cast.\r\n\r\nYou can queue a spell before entering a level (while it's still loading), which causes it to take effect to where your cursor was on the level beforehand. So, if the stairs down were on the left side of the upper level, and the entranceway below was on the right side of the lower level, you could cast Teleport and cross the entire lower level instantly. Same goes with other spells such as Town Portal. You can also cause illegal spells in town to occur this way, although the timing is very difficult to get right.\r\n\r\nCertain spells from scrolls can be cast twice if a character casts a read, known spell and interrupts it with the scroll spell, casting twice in rapid succession. This is because the game queues the scroll spell before it realizes it can only be cast once.\r\n\r\nA spell from a staff can be cast even if you run out by queuing the spell before the last spell casts.\r\n\r\n## SCROLL SPELL LEVELS\r\n\r\nScrolls of spells that you cannot read books of (i.e. Infravision) will be cast at the spell level of whatever book-read spell you have selected in your speedbook, when the scroll is cast from the belt. A level 15 Infravision can last a long time.\r\n\r\n## INCORRECT SCROLL DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nScrolls often have the wrong directions for casting.  Scrolls either have a \"Right-click to read\" description or a \"Right-click to read. Left-click to target\" description.  On many spells, the description is wrong.  For instance, the Flash spell scroll has the 'left-click to target' description, even though left clicking is not required.\r\n\r\n## INCORRECT SIGNED/UNSIGNED VALUES\r\n\r\nA bug exists where you can cast spells while you have negative mana.  This can result in incorrect values for spells that depend on mana.  For example, a golem is nearly invincible if it is cast while you have negative mana.  The game treats the negative value as unsigned and thus an enormous HP value is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n# LAG AND DESYNC BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are generally caused by lag and game desyncronization.\r\n\r\n## TOWN PLACEMENT OF \"HOTPOINTS\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally the characters (\"hotpoints\") in town will be in a wildly different location than normal (such as a cow placed right next to Griswold). This is caused by clients arguing over the true position of these hotpoints.\r\n\r\n## TOWN PLACEMENT OF DROPPED ITEMS\r\n\r\nWhen dropping items in town and entering the dungeon, upon return to town the items dropped will have sometimes moved, even to impossible locations - such as inside buildings or across the Tristram borders. This is caused by other players entering the game and not receiving the correct information as to town placement, so the entering client \"moves\" all the items around (as long as no other clients are in town).\r\n\r\n## DISAPPEARING ITEMS\r\n\r\nOccasionally an item will simply disappear when a character tries to pick it up. It is believed to be caused by lag, although there are reports of occurrences in Single Player mode - which may be a wholly different bug. Generally however this is a result of a game desync, when clients do not agree as to the items that were \"generated\" by dying monsters.\r\n\r\n## DESYNCED LEVELS\r\n\r\nWhen playing with a partner, it is possible to play in a disjointed level (possibly related to previous bug). This occurs when the level layouts are different for each player. This causes strange effects such as watching your partner walk through walls. You may also see completely different monsters. It is highly dangerous to play this way, and both players should leave the level immediately.\r\n\r\n## WRONG CHARACTER STATUS\r\n\r\nCharacters can sometimes appear dead, permanently stunned, equipment-less, or other ways due to game desyncs when the player changes his/her status, or when suddenly leaving the game.\r\n\r\n## PLAYER GHOSTS\r\n\r\nIf a player leaves the game while in a \"trouble\" situation (i.e. swarmed by monsters), it may not have a graceful exit. The character's \"ghost\" remains, the picture of the player. It can be highlighted by another player, even attacked. On other players' screens that can see the ghost, they may see monsters try to attack the ghost.\r\n\r\n## EXITING PLAYERS\r\n\r\nWhen a player is lagged out, or \"times out\" of a game, the other clients will occasionally see a \"Player has left the game\" message instead of the time out message.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n# EQUIPMENT BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are related to effects caused by equipment or equipment generation.\r\n\r\n## STEALTH EFFECTS\r\n\r\nWhen using items that reduce a character's light radius, a character will only activate monsters who are in that light radius. However, the character's light radius for attracting monsters depends upon the highest light radius the character had on a level until he/she exits the level. If the light radius is increased/decreased while on the level, it will alter the player's light radius, but not in terms of monster attraction - they will be attracted to the highest radius that existed at any time on the character. In other words, always have stealth equipment equipped BEFORE entering a level, and if you drop a stealth item, you'll have to leave the level and come back to use its effect on monster attraction again.\r\n\r\nWhen at full stealth level (-80% light radius), walls sometimes cannot be mapped even when the character is right next to them. Also, portions of the map for a level will appear as revealed very far away from the character's position. And, last of all, you won't see a monster one square away from you if it's at a diagonal angle. It won't see you, either.\r\n\r\n## HIGH DURABILITY WRAPAROUND\r\n\r\nWhen a character is saved with an item that has over 255 durability, its durability wraps around back to 1 to 10 durability. This can cause strange effects when using Hidden Shrines or finding items with durability-boosting suffixes that would normally cause its durability to be higher than 255.\r\n\r\nIf you use Hidden Shrines to take an item to exactly 255 durability, the item will transform to an indestructible item. This is because Blizzard used 255 in their code that checks whether an item is indestructible.\r\n\r\nItems raised to 256 durability with Hidden Shrines have a number of problems.  When starting a new game, the item will have zero maximum durability.  Any attempt to repair the item at Griswold will then crash the game.  Any attempt to repair the item with a warrior's Repair Skill (when it is something other than 0/0 durability) will result in the either the immediate disappearance of the item, or the item will become unselectable and will disappear when clicked on again.\r\n\r\n## GRISWOLD'S REPAIRS\r\n\r\nOccasionally Griswold will charge you for repairing an item and yet not repair it, forcing you to have to pay for repairs again, and possibly multiple times.\r\n\r\nGriswold will not repair a cursed item because its value to him is negative or less than one.\r\n\r\nGriswold can only repair an item when at least 1% of its durability has been lost; therefore, items over 100 durability can only be repaired after they've lost more than one durability point (over 200, 2 points).\r\n\r\n## ADRIA'S ISSUES\r\n\r\nOccasionally Adria will charge you for recharging a staff and yet not recharge it, forcing you to have to pay for recharge again, and possibly multiple times.\r\n\r\nAdria will recharge a staff for free if the number of charges to be reset is less than 1% of the total number of charges on the staff.\r\n\r\nIf you sell an item at Adria and you don't have enough room for the cash to be placed in your inventory, the excess gold is lost.\r\n\r\n## DEADLY HUNTER\r\n\r\nThis unique bow is listed as doing +200% damage versus demons, just as the BloodSlayer (axe) and Civerb's Cudgel (mace). However, while the Civerb's Cudgel and Bloodslayer have the effect of tripling a characters total damage to demons (not the weapon damage, but the total), the Deadly Hunter does not. This is caused by the way the game engine handles arrows differently than melee weapons.\r\n\r\n## IMPOSSIBLE ITEMS\r\n\r\nDue to the item generation rules of Diablo, these unique items cannot be found: Bramble, Crackrust, Lightforge, The Deflector, Gonnagal's Dirk, and The Mangler.\r\n\r\n## KING'S VS. CHAMPION'S PREFIX\r\n\r\nThe prefix \"Champion's,\" while being weaker than \"King's,\" is considered more valuable in terms of rarity in the game. This causes \"Champion's\" to be unfindable from any monster; it can only be bought from Wirt. This is a result of a hasty change in the value of the \"King's\" prefix before the release of the game - it was lowered to make it easier to obtain, and \"Champion's\" was not.\r\n\r\n## SWING SPEED\r\n\r\nThe suffix \"of Haste\" is supposed to be faster than \"of Speed,\" but they both produce the same swing speed as they eliminate the same number of animation frames on an attack. Blizzard incorrectly claims this was fixed in the 1.07 patch.\r\n\r\nThe suffix \"of readiness\" (designed to drop one frame of animation) is useless.\r\n\r\n## DEATH WITH CURSED ITEMS\r\n\r\nWhen dying from monsters' attacks, a character loses all items. If he/she was carrying items that lower hitpoints, he/she will regain the hitpoints that were drained by those (either cursed items or certain uniques). Upon dropping the items, the player will sometimes reach a value of hit points greater than zero - but the character will remain dead on his/her screen. For other players in the game this character has positive hitpoints, though, and thus they will not see a corpse and thus be unable to cast resurrect on him/her.\r\n\r\n## SHARP PREFIX\r\n\r\nThe prefix \"Sharp\" is considered a cursed prefix by the game (it shouldn't be), so you can't buy it in town.\r\n\r\n## CURSED AC ROUNDING\r\n\r\nWhen a cursed prefix or suffix modifies the AC value of an item, it is supposed to lower the AC. However, if the amount of AC to be lowered rounds down to zero, the AC is actually raised by 1. For example, an AC 3 helm with -26% AC will yield an AC of 4, since 26% of 3 is rounded to 1.\r\n\r\n## \"RED\" ITEMS\r\n\r\n\"Red\" items (i.e. items that you are \"wearing\" but cannot use because you don't meet the requirements), put on your character by using an item that gave you the requirements, equipping it, and then removing the item that allowed you to use it, will lose durability just like items you're allowed to use.\r\n\r\nEven though a red item cannot be used by your character, it will still modify your damage based on weapon type.  If you use a \"red\" sword, for instance, your fist damage will be raised by 1.5 times when you punch animals, and lowered by 0.5 times when you punch undead.\r\n\r\n## GRISWOLD/WIRT PRICING INCONSISTENCY\r\n\r\nIf you buy an item from Wirt and then go to sell it to Griswold, he will offer you one fourth of the price you paid Wirt for it.  If you then start a new game, however, Griswold will only offer you one fourth of what HE would sell it for (less money).\r\n\r\n## CORRUPTION SUFFIX\r\n\r\nEquipping an item \"of Corruption\" when you have negative mana will actually GIVE you mana, setting your mana to zero.\r\n\r\nIf you equip an item of corruption and afterwards equip mana adding items, mana will still be added.  Also, when you take off the corruption item and re-equip it, mana will not be reset to 0, but instead to what it previously was (i.e., mana from items equipped after equipping the corruption item will still be added).\r\n\r\nMore seriously, if your character has negative max mana (possible with mana-reducing items such as the Cranium Basher), using an item of Corruption will set your mana to zero.  Removing it keeps your current mana at zero (of a max of a negative number).  If you then unequip the item(s) which gave you negative max mana, the game will immediately crash.  Don't try this at home.\r\n\r\n## GOLD IMAGE STABILITY\r\n\r\nImages of gold piles are updated incorrectly sometimes.  For instance, if you have two piles of gold totaling between 5,000 and 10,000 gold, you can merge one gold pile with the other and the amounts will switch.  If this causes one pile to obtain a \"smaller\" shape, drop it on the ground and pick it back up - it will have the older image of a larger pile again.\r\n\r\n## UNFINDABLE ITEMS IN DUNGEONS\r\n\r\nMonsters in each level of difficulty have the same value for item drops in terms of prefixes and suffixes; therefore, many high-end prefixes and suffixes can never be dropped by a monster. Specifically, these prefixes and suffixes cannot be found on items dropped by monsters: Mammoth, Whale, Holy, Godly, Weird, Strange, Champion's, Ruthless, Merciless, Carnage, Slaughter, Osmosis, Burning, and Thunder.  Only Wirt can sell you these prefixes and suffixes.  Hydra's and Wyrm's enchantments cannot be generated in town or in dungeon.\r\n\r\n## FIRE/LIGHTNING SUFFIX ISSUES\r\n\r\nDamage from Fire or Lightning elemental arrows will occasionally be highly excessive. It is caused by the calculation for the damage occurring multiple times as it hits its target. This occurs on traps sometimes, as well.\r\n\r\nWhen a monster is hit by a fire damage arrow, it stops regenerating hit points.  This even applies to the Dark Lord, Diablo.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n# DUNGEON LAYOUT/POSITIONAL BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are related to problems with dungeon layouts, level transitions, the positions of objects, and other errors caused by the tile layout design of the game.\r\n\r\n## SCREEN DRAW ERRORS IN CAVES\r\n\r\nCertain wall formations in the caves can cause screen draw problems which are harmless. This is caused by spots on the level map that do not contain graphics, usually seen as stalagmites. Images in them will \"ripple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mirroring\" effects can be seen where a character's image will appear in lava pools.\r\n\r\n## LEVEL RESETS\r\n\r\nOccasionally, if you go down a set of stairs, back up, and back down again, the entire level changes. This includes wall placements, creatures, etc...which can lead to you arriving in the middle of a pack of monsters, or a wall.\r\n\r\n## HELL'S INVISIBLE WALLS\r\n\r\nSometimes in Hell levels, especially level 16, hidden walls exist which cannot be seen by the player but are treated as physical barriers that also block sight and shots. There seems to be a correlation between dead body parts hung on walls (aka \"Shish Kebabs\") and hidden wall squares.\r\n\r\n## HOLES IN THE WALL\r\n\r\nMany walls in the game have holes in them that allow arrows and spells to leak through. One such hole exists on the left side of Lazarus' chamber.\r\n\r\n## IMPOSSIBLE LEVELS\r\n\r\nVery rarely will a level be generated that is not continuous - it is split into sides that can only be accessed by casting Phasing or Teleport.\r\n\r\n## FAR OFF MAP SQUARES\r\n\r\nOccasionally dotted map squares, corresponding to walls and inaccessible areas, will be visible on the map upon level entry - even when being very far away.\r\n\r\n## MONSTERS IN WALLS\r\n\r\nMonsters will occasionally appear inside closed doors or walls, as they are generated there. As soon as they enter your light radius they simply walk out of the wall/door they were \"in.\"\r\n\r\n## RANGED ATTACK ANGLES\r\n\r\nCertain angles of ranged attack against monsters will result in a character being unable to hit them; the character will have to move a square to be able to score a hit. Shots fired in straight lines to the target are much easier to connect.\r\n\r\n## SHARING SQUARES\r\n\r\nWhen a character teleports/phases onto a square that a monster was moving in to, they will overlap. The character will have to move off the square to hit the monster. The monster, however, can attack the same square it's standing on.\r\n\r\nIf two characters wind up occupying the same square, which can happen rarely when casting Teleport or when Resurrecting while standing over a body, the player who does not move will become invisible to both players, until he/she moves. Further, the player first on the internal list of players may be the first targeted and attacked if a monster approaches.\r\n\r\nThe player can also share a square with a Golem.\r\n\r\n## STAIRWAY PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nA character can teleport/phase into a stairway leading down in Hell levels and \"levitate\" in the open area inside the \"cage\" of the stairway. He/she can then shoot ranged attacks out of the mouth of the stairway, but no ranged attacks from monsters can get in from certain angles.\r\n\r\nIf you enter the caves via the cave mouth entrance near Wirt, you can run the mouse cursor over the stairs on level 9, and a small spot on the right side of the stairs will read \"up to level 8.\" If you left click on that spot your character will begin walking towards the level 8 stairs (even if you can't see them on the map), unless the way is blocked by lava, grates, or some other obstacle. If you teleport onto that spot, your character will teleport all the way to the level 8 stairs and go up!\r\n\r\nPlayers can \"block\" stairways when they enter them. A \"ghost\" image of the character remains at the stair entrance to the other players, and remains until the stair-taking player finishes loading up the next level. This blocking effect occurs 100% of the time when the player has a Mana Shield cast.\r\n\r\nMonsters that use Hidden AI are always active.  Unless there's a barrier between them and the player (e.g. closed door, barrels completely blocking a path), they'll reach the player without any action on the player's part.\r\n\r\nThe game normally doesn't generate monsters within a certain range of the stairs.  This does not apply to rooms, however.  For example, you may enter a level of the caves and find Storm Demons waiting 7 squares away, placed there because they are inside a fenced area. They will fire at you immediately, open the door, and come after you.\r\n\r\n## BOSS LIGHT RADII\r\n\r\nAll bosses in Diablo emit a light radius visible to players. If they move, their light radius moves as well. However, if you leave the level and re-enter, the bosses original positions will have a light radius on the floor, even when the boss' dead body is located at a different position on the level.\r\n\r\n## LEVEL ENTRANCE DISPLACEMENT\r\n\r\nWhen players use stairwells to go down, each player will see the other in the wrong spot at next level, with their player being in the \"correct\" position and the partner displaced. When the characters move, the game engine corrects this situation by showing the other player walk one space over.\r\n\r\nIn a similar fashion, a player taking another player's Town Portal down to a level can wind up on the other side of a wall if the portal was placed just to the \"north\" of the wall. This is due to a displacement of one square, as the player cannot land on the exact square of the Portal (they'd head right back up again, then).\r\n\r\n## TRAP RESETTING\r\n\r\nIf a door with a trap is opened, thus setting off the trap, and the door is closed again, you can \"reset\" the trap. Leave the level and come back to it, and the trap will be reset.\r\n\r\n## 127 LIMIT\r\n\r\nYou cannot drop more than 127 items on the floor in any one level, including town. Note that this can cause you to lose monster drops if you have 127 items on the floor of a level, since a dying monster will have no \"room\" to drop it and it will simply never exist. Remember that every pile of gold is an \"item.\"\r\n\r\nDiablo also has a 127 limit as to the number of ongoing spell effects (including arrows) that can appear on a level at any one time, which is 127. Some spells, especially Chain Lightning, can use up several effects.\r\n\r\n## ITEM DROPS ON SHRINE/BOOKCASE TILES\r\n\r\nIf an item drops on the tile for a shrine or bookcase, you cannot highlight or pick up the item until activating the shrine or bookcase.\r\n\r\n## MOONBENDER'S LIGHT RADIUS\r\n\r\nThe light square of Moonbender (a Blink boss) will freeze in place if it 'blinks' next to you, and won't follow the boss even if the boss moves afterward.\r\n\r\n## UNHITTABLE WHEN WALKING HORIZONTALLY\r\n\r\nWhen a character (or monster) walks horizontally on the screen (as in on your monitor), he/she/it cannot be hit by most spells and ALL arrows, even when fired on the same line of action of the walker.\r\n\r\n## GOING UP AND DOWN STAIRS\r\n\r\nYou will only descend a stairwell while you're in \"walk\" mode.  Other actions, such as swinging or casting, will prevent you from descending a staircase.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n# MISCELLANEOUS BUGS\r\n\r\nEverything else.\r\n\r\n## DUPLICATES\r\n\r\nVarious duplication bugs/quirks exist in Diablo.\r\n\r\nVendors can occasionally sell duplicates.  Duplicates of potions are somewhat common since the range of ID numbers assigned to potions is rather small\r\n\r\nYou'll occasionally find the exact same item twice (or even thrice) in the same dungeon.  After ID'ing, these items will produce a duplicate item message when simultaneously dropped.\r\n\r\nThe commonly abused duplication has to do with the item-pickup routine. Blizzard has never fixed the item-pickup bug.  They claim that it cannot be fixed without an overhaul of the game engine, but this seems incorrect as it has been fixed in modifications.\r\n\r\n## FIFTH SPELL BOOK PAGE\r\n\r\nClicking on the small area between the number 4 and the right edge of the spellbook causes a blank page to appear.\r\n\r\n## PRICE LIMIT\r\n\r\nThe upper limit to the price of items Griswold or Adria can sell you is 140,000 gold, even though a character could still buy an item that takes up six slots and carry 170,000 gold. Wirt's limit is 135,000 gold.\r\n\r\n## FAMILIARS\r\n\r\nFamiliars are demons and not animals like all of the other bat types.\r\n\r\n## BOSS AND MONSTER APPEARANCE\r\n\r\nDue to the dungeon level assignments of bosses and their corresponding monster types in the code, certain bosses can never appear in the game. For example, Lord of the Pit (Azure Drake boss) is assigned to appear on dlvl 13 whereas Azure drakes cannot appear on 13; thus, no boss.\r\n\r\nSome bosses are assigned monster types which don't appear in-game. Monsters that don't appear: Invisible Lord, Lord Sayter, Wyrm, Cave Slug, Devil Wyrm, Devourer, Bone Demon, Red Death, Litch Demon, Undead Balrog, Incinerator, Flame Lord, Doom Fire, Hell Burner, Devil Kin Brute, Unraveler, Hollow One, Pain Master, Reality Weaver, The Arch-Litch Malignus. (Satyr Lords, Devil Kin Brutes, Bone Demons, and Unravelers do make an appearance in Hellfire, however.)  Bosses not appearing in the game:\r\n\r\n## *Name* - Type: Dungeon level\r\n\r\n- *Blightstone the Weak* - Lord Sayter: 4\r\n- *Hazeshifter* - Unseen: 5\r\n- *Warmaggot the Mad* - Wyrm: 6\r\n- *Glasskull the Jagged* - Red Storm\t: 7\r\n- *Wrathfire the Doomed* - Incinerator: 8\r\n- *Bronzefist Firestone* - Hellstone: 8\r\n- *Doomgrin the Rotting* - Red Death: 8\r\n- *Stormbane* - Storm Rider: 9\r\n- *Madburner* - Flame Lord: 9\r\n- *Lord of the Pit* - Azure Drake: 13\r\n- *Bonesaw the Litch* - Litch Demon: 9\r\n- *Grimspike* - Obsidian Lord: 19\r\n- *Devilskull Sharpbone* - Red Death: 9\r\n- *Doomlock* - Storm Lord - 28\r\n- *Warpfire Hellspawn* - Hell Burner: 11\r\n- *Blacktongue* - Counselor: 12\r\n- *Festerskull* - Undead Balrog: 11\r\n- *Soulslash* - Unraveler: 12\r\n- *Howlingire the Shade* - Hollow One: 13\r\n- *Bloodmoon Soulfire* - Pain Master: 13\r\n- *Zamphir* - Reality Weaver: 15\r\n\r\n## SHRINES\r\n\r\nAn Enchanted Shrine will reduce a spell by two levels if it is base level 15, instead of just one spell level reduction. This is caused by how the shrine works - it raises all spell levels by one and then picks a spell to reduce by 2 levels. A level 15 spell will not raise to 16 and then go down to 14, it will stay 15 and be reduced to 13.\r\n\r\nMysterious Shrines, Tainted Shrines, and Fountains of Tears do the same kind of thing with character stats - they can pick a stat to be raised that's already maxed, and wind up lowering all the other stats.\r\n\r\nDue to a design flaw in how the game engine handles the random effects in shrines, Hidden Shrines will tend to reduce the durability of the item in the right slot (left hand) more often. Mysterious Shrines will tend to raise Dexterity more often than other stats. Enchanted shrines will tend to reduce Chain Lightning more often than the other spells. This effect becomes less noticeable the more you play in a single gaming session, i.e. the shrine effects will become more 'random.' Namely, the \"random seed\" stored with ANY shrine is not initialized properly, and the shrine uses whatever happens to be in that memory location. At startup this memory will mostly be \"empty\", which is read as zero, which then causes the non-random behavior. After the game is played for a while, the memory is much less likely to be zero, and therefore tends to approach randomness.\r\n\r\n## ZERO HIT POINT ISSUES\r\n\r\nUnder special circumstances a character can wind up with 0 hit points and yet not die. The character then is invincible to all forms of attack unless he/she heals or has Heal Other cast upon the character. This is apparently caused by some portions of the code treating -1 HP as death, not 0.\r\n\r\nA character with negative hit points will be killed by any sort of Healing.\r\n\r\n## RESURRECT IN TOWN\r\n\r\nOccasionally when a character is resurrected by another player in the dungeons, players in town can see the beam of light in town corresponding to the player's position on a level in the dungeon.\r\n\r\n## DUPE MESSAGE ON GAME ENTRY\r\n\r\nIf a player enters a game at the exact same time that another player drops an item in town, the entering player will see a \"A duplicate item has been detected from another player\" message.\r\n\r\n## PLAYER FRIENDLY MODE IN DUELS\r\n\r\nIf you use a melee weapon against a character who has set themselves on \"Player Friendly\" you cannot stun lock him/her. This does not apply to attacks with a a bow.\r\n\r\n## KNOCKBACK PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nWhen being hit by a creature with knockback power (or a character with a knockback weapon) such as Diablo or a charging beast, you can be knocked back physically, but your light radius does not move unless your character makes some form of move (either walking or attacking). Thus, you can eventually be knocked outside of your own light radius and all creatures will disappear.\r\n\r\nKnockback bows do not knock enemies back 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nHitting a monster/player will knock them back according to the direction they are facing; thus, you can technically knock a creature back towards you if it's facing away from you.\r\n\r\n## SINGLE PLAYER DIFFICULTY LEVELS\r\n\r\nIf you start a multiplayer game at Nightmare or Hell difficulty and then quit to start a single player game, the single player game will be the same difficulty as the multiplayer one, including the value of experience per monster, gold drops, etc.\r\n\r\n## BOSS ERRORS\r\n\r\nPowerful bosses in higher levels of difficulty have their experience level overflow, as the game calculates the experience level for them too many times.\r\n\r\nBosses in Nightmare and Hell difficulties are sometimes far weaker than they should be, with poor AC and to-hit%. This is because these values are byte values and they overflow with higher difficulty bonuses.\r\n\r\nDiablo in Nightmare and Hell difficulties suffers from the same problem as the bosses above.\r\n\r\n## LEVEL 50 CROSSOVER PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nAny partners in a game where a player levels up to 50 will still see the player as level 49 in that game.\r\n\r\nA character does not receive a hit point or mana point bonus on leveling to 50.\r\n\r\n## SINGLE PLAYER LEVEL BONUSES\r\n\r\nPlayers get an extra 1/64th HP and MP on leveling up in single player in addition to a full 64/64.\r\n\r\n## GOLD LOSS ON DEATH\r\n\r\nIf you are carrying a large amount of gold in your inventory, you stand to lose much more than half of it when you die. The game won't drop enough piles of it and the piles themselves will have less than 5,000 gold each. It apparently doesn't generate the gold correctly when you are defeated.\r\n\r\n## EARS\r\n\r\nEars from the same character are duplicates.\r\n\r\nIf a player dies from a PK attack and an ear from that character is already on the floor somewhere, a new ear will not be generated (related to bug above).\r\n\r\n## YEAR 2039 RANDOMIZER ISSUE\r\n\r\nThe game engine will stop creating random levels after midnight of January 1, 2039. Any game started before January 1, 1970, will also not be random.\r\n\r\n## CHARACTER DAMAGE UPDATE UPON LEVEL UP\r\n\r\nWhen a character levels up, the damage displayed in the character screen may be incorrect until the status of the character changes. Status changes include the removal and/or applying of equipment or a raise in character attributes.\r\n\r\n## TRAP DAMAGE\r\n\r\nTrap damage does not get increased by difficulty.  Traps in Nightmare and Hell difficulties do the same amount of damage as the ones in Normal.  This makes traps for high-level characters meaningless.\r\n\r\n## ATTRIBUTE WRAPAROUND\r\n\r\nIf an attribute of a character becomes negative, which can be accomplished through the use of Mysterious and Tainted Shrines (by partners touching them), on starting a new game the character's attribute will wrap around to 255-value.  If magic or vitality wrap around this way, the character will NOT gain the hit points and mana one would expect from this \"gain.\"  For example, if a warrior obtains -2 magic, in the next game he starts he'll have 253 magic (which will then be limited to 50 magic, his max).  However, a character will not gain mana from this wrap around, thus harshly corrupting the character.\r\n\r\n## BLOCK BONUS LOSS\r\n\r\nCharacters in Diablo are supposed to have a blocking bonus;  30 for a warrior, 20 for a rogue, and 10 for a sorcerer.  This would be equivalent to a warrior having 30 more dexterity in terms of blocking ability, and likewise for the other two classes.  However, this bonus is not saved with the character when it is saved (via Save Game in Single Player or Exit Game in Multiplayer).  Thus, a character has a blocking bonus when it is started which is lost forever after the first session - a huge loss for ironman characters.\r\n\r\n## TOWN TALKING\r\n\r\nIf you press F1 to open the help screen and then talk to a townsperson, pressing F1 to clear the help screen overlay causes the talk menu to stretch out across the screen.  When this happens, you cannot select any of the talk menu's options and must clear it using the Esc key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n# GAMEPLAY BUGS FIXED IN PREVIOUS OR CURRENT VERSIONS OF DIABLO\r\n\r\n## VERSION 1.08\r\n\r\n- *Mac Only* Improved Mac vs. PC multiplayer, modem, and direct connect.\r\n\r\n## VERSION 1.07\r\n\r\n- Fixed crashes associated with being attacked or killed by a Black Death (Zombie class).

When a fix is found and added via comment to the code the issue could be closed. this way there would be a better overview of the known bugs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could also implement the fixes not as comments but in an IF DEFINED statement instead so that a bugfree version could be compiled with a special flag.","I love the first idea, but `IF DEFINED statement` is an issue. For one, some bugs are graphical and require patching game assets. Two, those that are code related, many are certainly not just a clean one-liner and some are tied to multiple functions. Some may be relevant to another bugfix or require rewriting a function here, fixing this there etc. In the end you'd end up with something that looks almost as ugly as what IDA spat out.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to point no. 2. This probably wasn't mentioned before so here it is: my long term goal was to get the code cleaned up and produce 100% exact results (which we did). Afterwards, using the code as a ***reference*** from which everything can be rewritten from the ground up. This would allow fixing bugs, modern coding practices, more efficient and easier to mod etc. while guaranteed accurate unlike the many re-implementation projects floating around that were based off guesswork.\r\n(It's not open source, but I've done this with Diablo's UI using the original as a guide)\r\n\r\nSo imo Devilution should die where it is. Some asswipe released the official code (hey buddy that's great but ya' could have done so sooner ok??). Which effectively achieves the above goal several times over in that now we have the purest reference from which to work, but also rendered many manual-hours by me (and a few others) nigh-useless. So there is our starting point, don't use it, don't copy it, but reference it. The even tastier fruit is for all hands taking.\r\n\r\nWhat the new owner(s) of Devilution do is up to them: _Buy it break it fix it smash it melt it love it hate it burn it_. If coming up with a multiple if-def nested monster is what they choose or not. Just my 2 cents, the last 2 cents I had saved up for college.","The idea is definitely nice, but I agree that a lot of ifdef is going to turn ugly real quick. Instead, we are fixing them in DevilutionX 1.x.y. We have also unified the shareware and retail version and made it detected what version to run depending on the provided MPQ and intend to do the same with hellfire exactly to minimize the amount of ifdef found in the code.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick example of what issues you quickly encounter with a lot of `ifdef` in the code:\r\n```cpp\r\n#ifdef FIX\r\nif (bug && fix) {\r\n#else\r\nif (bug) {\r\n#endif\r\n    // Am I indented once or twice?\r\n}\r\n// is this file broken?\r\n```","Forgot to mention that as well but yeah we have a lot of those from debug related ifdef code. At least on Windows I use Notepad++ which has the ability to fold nested code, and it causes lots of issues since it doesn't know where to stop.","You've convinced me.

In that case, no OFILE_CANDLE2 assets are loaded.\r\n\r\nIf the assets are not loaded, then a second bug happens, where while searching for the assets the game will simply run off past the end of an array into no-man's-land until it randomly finds a byte that matches what it is looking for.

There are two unique items in the game which can spawn on two base items. \"Gnarled Root\" (Club/Spiked Club) and \"Stormshield\" (Tower/Gothic Shield). This is definitely a bug as items in the global item table are supposed to have a unique ID per item, so unique items can reference that ID. However, Club/Spiked Club use the same ID instead of the latter being none. Same applies to tower shield.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Warrior's Club has the same entry for unique item lookup as Club. It should be empty however. Lightforge also uses the wrong lookup type in the unique item table, using a regular mace, allowing it to drop. It always morphs on a new game because of this. It is a quest item and special drop.","Empty mana orb doesn't match background:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/204594/133828679-bab3c69c-9041-4a44-a928-3af74606e9fc.png)\r\n(there are bits of gold in the wing from a previous UI element at that position)","The way diablo chooses levels for magic affixes is buggy and leads to several problems. So I'll explain. First they are chosen in one of three ways depending on item type:\r\n- **All items but staves**: min level is 1/2 base level and capped to 25\r\n- Staves **with** charges: no minimum affix level\r\n- Staves **without** charges: min level is 1/2 base level and *not* capped\r\n\r\nBug # 1: Staves are like jewelry in that they are *always* supposed to be magic or contain charges. It is possible however to find a plain white staff. For example, a level 4 monster drops a magic staff with a suffix, however there are no suffixes between the level range (2-4) thus it drops without anything.\r\n\r\nBug # 2: Minimum magic level is capped to 25 max. Now only Wirt is capable of generating items this high. Why is this a problem? It means past a certain point some affixes stop spawning. At character level 50, Wirt can no longer sell Obsidian (thus the famous Ob Zods).\r\n\r\nWhen fixing monsters to drop with their difficulty bonus, it opens up a plethora of affix bugs.\r\n- Level 50+ monsters can't drop staves with a suffix\r\n- Various other items have few/no affixes once monsters reach a high enough level\r\n\r\nWhen removing the level cap, it additionally opens up these bugs:\r\n- Rings/amulets dropped by level 56+ monsters can only spawn with one affix, Zodiac. No prefixes spawn\r\n- Certain unique monsters such as Lazarus, on **_hell difficulty_**, will only drop white rings/amulets (no affixes at all)\r\n\r\nThis may just be an odd design quirk, but once you fix monsters, the minimum level set on affixes really starts breaking the game.\r\n","Diablo's magical unique loot system explained using staff of shadows as an example:\r\nStaff of shadows uses long staff (lvl 4) as a base and is lvl 2 itself.\r\nIf multiple unique items meet the requirements, the one lowest on the list gets chosen.\r\nImmolator is lvl 4 and uses a long staff base too.\r\n\r\nWhich means in theory staff of shadows can never drop, because if lvl 4+ loot drops (to roll the long staff), then immolator will always gets picked over staff of shadows. Ofc you can get it to drop in single player if immolator drops first, because then it will stop blocking staff of shadows - such a staff will morph back into immolator in vanilla's new game.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's possible to get a stable one because of a bug described in https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/pull/2763\r\nItem generation is messed up because monster level increased by difficulty bonus/unique monster bonus is only used for generating the base item - affix/unique item generation uses monster's starting level (ignoring boss/difficulty modifiers)\r\nWhich means there's one scenario where staff of shadows can drop - lvl 2 or 3 monster on nightmare/hell difficulty.\r\nLet's take a lvl 2 monster as an example.\r\nDifficulty bonus = 15 on nightmare and 30 on hell.\r\nBase item would roll with (2 + difficulty bonus) level, which means a long staff can drop.\r\nBut affix/unique item would get rolled with the original level = 2 = congrats, it's a staff of shadows!\r\n\r\nTo make it even more confusing, unique monsters have a hardcoded +4 bonus to affix/unique generation level BUT NOT the base item level - which means that you can only get staff of shadows from a NON-UNIQUE lvl 2-3 monster on nightmare/hell difficulty, because if it was a unique monster, the long staff could always hit immolator.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a bug because there's 0 reason why for example celestial bow (which looks like something a lvl 3 rogue would be happy about but later? ...) can only drop on nightmare or hell ;)\r\n\r\nTo make it even more funny, it means that in singleplayer you can get some uniques in 2 versions - stable or unstable that will morph in a new game.\r\nAn unstable staff of shadows would drop if it only dropped because you already got immolator before it and a stable one would drop from a scenario described above.\r\nHope that's not very confusing, only took 25 years to find out \uD83E\uDD2A \r\n","Adjacent attack damage from Monk, Bard, and Barbarian attacks with certain weapon types is handled by calling the damage function again but passing the negative `pnum` value for that player. The negative value signals to the function that the chance to hit and damage penalties for adjacent damage should apply to the attack. However, player 1 has a `pnum` value of `0` so instead of a negative number, it just passes `0` and calculates damage as normal. This means the chance to hit and damage penalties do not apply to player 1, but they do apply to other players.","Runes of Lightning never deal damage. When a monster steps on the rune, a Lightball missile is generated on the tile, but damage is never set for the missile, so min and max damage are both 0.

This means that you can have a player receive less than full XP while another player receives full XP. This happens when a player has hit a monster, another player loads onto the level and kills the hit monster before anyone else hits the monster again. The player that loaded onto the floor only sees themselves hit the monster, so they get full XP, while the original player (or players) get split XP.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/issues/3110\r\n\r\nI also noticed that monster tags get cleared (mWhoHit) if all players leave a floor. I'd say it's debatable if this is a bug or not, but feels like it is (and feels connected to the above issue).\r\n\r\nEditing to add: https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/issues/3111\r\n\r\nI did not test to confirm, but it is very likely this issue with mWhoHit is also Vanilla behavior. It's possible for mWhoHit to just desync altogether even if all players were on the floor during a fight with a monster. As described in the linked issue, the player that attempted the attack missed, but the other player saw the hit land, so mWhoHit desynced. If the player that saw a hit now kills the monster, they get half XP while the other player gets 0 XP. Monster health did not desync at all, so mWhoHit does not use the same mechanisms that damage to monsters use.","Monster hp is not synced when a player enters the level.\r\nPlayer 1 damages a monster\r\nPlayer 2 enters level and sees the monster with full hp.","Monsters will inform the group lader that they spotted the player, but the leader will not inform the rest of the pack.

Here is a graph showing the intermediate price of an item during this calculation, right after applying the multiplier to an item with a base value of 1000.\r\n\r\n![intermediate-price](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9203145/164746603-1043f063-db1b-424e-a7e1-4f3dc0da8cc3.png)\r\n\r\nSo long as the multiplier is positive, everything seems okay. But when the graph slips into negative multipliers, it seems that the more extreme negative values produce a more valuable item than the less extreme ones. Normally, this doesn't matter because cursed affixes nearly always define their adder as 0 so the multiplier alone will nearly always drive the final value of the computation into the negatives, which then gets coerced into an item value of 1 gold piece. However, this breaks down a bit with the Hyena's prefix which has a positive adder, so applying a cursed suffix to drive the multiplier down can actually increase the final price of the item.\r\n\r\nBased on the math used in the equation, it seems to me that the equation was meant to use the absolute value of the multiplier such that cursed affixes would merely reduce the effect of the base value on the final price of the item. Here's how the same graph would look with the absolute value correction.\r\n\r\n![corrected-price](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9203145/164748696-6f4e146b-7645-4c96-a517-31fd154ea0ae.png)\r\n\r\nMany people seem to have the misconception that items with cursed affixes should always be worth 1 gold piece, but the logic doesn't seem to support this.

They clearly intended to set the durability to 6 instead. The same bug appeared on Split Skull Shield in the demo, which they fixed by using 15 instead (6 would be too low).\r\n- **Hammer of Jholm**: It has +4-10% (varies) enhanced damage. This has no effect on the weapon since it is too low, but the unique item has a qlvl of 1. It seems more likely they meant to set the actual damage to 4-10 to make it weaker, but since mauls don't drop from level 1 monsters, it makes it useless. (Hence the reason this item has weak stats)\r\n- **Stormshield**: It's missing the lightning resist (in both demo+Diablo 2). They removed it to use the slot for changing the graphic.","I found an exploit created by the negative stat shrines. First, let's lay down a few rules:\r\n- Ornate, Sacred, and Fascinating shrines reduce mana by 10%. Sets mana to 0 if negative.\r\n- Mysterious shrine and Tear fountain remove 1 to a random stat.\r\n- When game saves, stat values are stored as unsigned.\r\n\r\nThis trick works best with a level 1 Warrior. If you hit enough shrines to get your magic reduced to -1, then start a new game, it will be 255 since the value is unsigned. If you click any item it will refresh back to 50 however. The idea is you get a bunch of books for spells you cannot learn, get your magic down to -1, make a new game and use the books as this will not reset the stat. You then have to reduce your magic all over again back to 0 this time, hit the shrines to set your mana to zero, then drink elixirs to get mana again.\r\n\r\nFor strength and dexterity which don't have stat effects, it works even better. On a level 1 warrior, you could save/load before the random stat shrines and keep hitting until you get them to -1, make a new game, then they will be maxed out!","There is formula for the damage of Guardian which is not being used and the damage of Firebolt is used instead:\r\nhttps://github.com/diasurgical/devilution/blob/50c9b533cf949e7a8e7cc61bdc539a8d60c19a4c/Source/missiles.cpp#L2772","The hit detection to determine which area of the inventory (or belt) is under the mouse cursor doesn't align with the panel graphics particularly well.\r\n\r\nIn the following image the green areas are base hit regions, depending on the action being performed an extra line of pixels above (and sometimes to the right) of these areas is also included.\r\n![2023-03-25T154617_devilutionx_markup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/357684/227701879-db6ba8d7-5ca9-465f-b0d6-2a0301eec0ed.png)\r\n\r\nUsing the left ring slot as an example rings are drawn as a 28x28 pixel sprite with the lower left corner at (48, 205) relative to the top left corner of the panel. The hit area is a 28x29 (when pasting an item) or 29x29 (when picking up an item) region with the lower left corner at (45, 205). The area inside the golden border visible in the panel UI is 28x29 pixels with the lower left corner at (47, 206).\r\n\r\nThe gap between columns in the left/right hand slots means that it's possible to pick up a weapon/shield and not be able to place it back down again unless you move the mouse one pixel left or right. This also happens with the gutters between columns of the inventory for items two tiles wide.","Click an NPC, while walking to them click and hold down the inv button. Once the NPC interaction starts let go of the inv button.\r\nYou will now have an unresponsive inventory UI on top of the NPC UI.","Rampant use of `SetRndSeed()` using the absolute value of RNG state breaks the flow of the RNG sequence and screws up the uniformity of the random number generator. You can see this demonstrated in Griswold's premium item generation algorithm. We discovered a rather small closed loop in that algorithm that produces just ten Hellfire items. By seeding the RNG just right and carrying a bunch of expensive gear in your inventory, you can force the shop to display the same item in every one of the shop's slots.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9203145/236270666-b70644e6-48f7-4bad-a118-a5caaf23ffdf.png)\r\n\r\nThe attached file below contains debug output where I traced the calls to the RNG functions in DevilutionX. The functions in DevilutionX are more or less just renamed from the original functions in Devilution.\r\n\r\n* `AdvanceRndSeed()` = `GetRndSeed()`\r\n* `SetRndSeed()` = `SetRndSeed()`\r\n* `GenerateRnd()` = `random_()`\r\n\r\n[hellfire-rng-closed-loop.txt](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution/files/11399512/hellfire-rng-closed-loop.txt)\r\n\r\nThe most obvious solution to this would be to use the unmodified RNG state when capturing a seed to be used later. However, it would also make some sense to implement the ability to instance the RNG so you can generate a specific item or object's random number sequence without disturbing the random number sequence of, say, the RNG used for game mechanics.","Because the game captures random numbers to be used later as seeds for the RNG, it's possible for two chests on the same dungeon level to produce duplicate items. The conditions for the simplest and most likely way for this to happen are outlined below.\r\n\r\n* The chest must drop at least two items.\r\n* The next chest that was placed must drop at least one item.\r\n* The RNG state must have been a positive integer when capturing the seed for the chest object.\r\n* The RNG state must have been a positive integer when capturing the seed for the next chest object that was placed.\r\n* The RNG state must be a positive integer when capturing the seed for the first item from the chest.\r\n* The \"RNG distance\" between the chest's seed and the next chest's seed must be the same as the number of random numbers used to generate the first item.\r\n\r\nIf the stars align, RNG state after generating the chest's first item will be identical to the seed for the chest that was placed after it. I captured the following output from Devilution using `glSeedTbl[1] = 312` and opening the chests at `object[87]` and `object[86]`. In this example, the game had generated a duplicate gold pile with seed `1292792715`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperating chest 87\r\nSetRndSeed(-1271890865 -> 23863461)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(23863461 -> 1549207594)\r\nrandom_(15) >> GetRndSeed(1549207594 -> -1421509453)\r\nGetRndSeed(-1421509453 -> 726620944) returns 726620944\r\nSetRndSeed(726620944 -> 726620944)\r\nrandom_(1) >> GetRndSeed(726620944 -> 952941137)\r\nrandom_(10) >> GetRndSeed(952941137 -> -190758714)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(-190758714 -> 1387969791)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(1387969791 -> 1994707660)\r\n[CreateRndItem] Gold (726620944)\r\n\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(1994707660 -> 1028770877)\r\nrandom_(15) >> GetRndSeed(1028770877 -> -1466179934)\r\nGetRndSeed(-1466179934 -> 1292792715) returns 1292792715\r\nSetRndSeed(1292792715 -> 1292792715)\r\nrandom_(1) >> GetRndSeed(1292792715 -> -2062531128)\r\nrandom_(10) >> GetRndSeed(-2062531128 -> -772709783)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(-772709783 -> 81747390)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(81747390 -> -1013298089)\r\n[CreateRndItem] Gold (1292792715)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperating chest 86\r\nSetRndSeed(-1013298089 -> 1994707660)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(1994707660 -> 1028770877)\r\nrandom_(15) >> GetRndSeed(1028770877 -> -1466179934)\r\nGetRndSeed(-1466179934 -> 1292792715) returns 1292792715\r\nSetRndSeed(1292792715 -> 1292792715)\r\nrandom_(1) >> GetRndSeed(1292792715 -> -2062531128)\r\nrandom_(10) >> GetRndSeed(-2062531128 -> -772709783)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(-772709783 -> 81747390)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(81747390 -> -1013298089)\r\n[CreateRndItem] Gold (1292792715)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe in this case, the safest solution would be to \"create space\" in the random number sequence by burning random numbers after capturing the object seed. The number of random numbers burned should be determined based on the expected number of random numbers it would take to generate the items from the chest.

That function is decorated with `_propagate_cosmo_array_attributes_to_result`, which tries to copy attributes of the first positional argument. If `coordinates` is passed as a kwarg it doesn't appear in `*args` and the decorator raises a fairly cryptic exception. I think that a sensible solution would be to use `/` in the function signature of functions that use this kind of decorator (there are a few similar ones in the `cosmo_array` related code) to enforce positional arguments be passed as positional. I think that in that case trying to do otherwise still raises an exception, but with a clear message for the user.

I stumbled apon you guys and I been looking at you work for a good 2-3hr straight tryna make sense of it, I've been going thru your code and selecting the blue highlighted words (idk what it was like your readme codes, NDK, xHook, at, and boardwalks and libraries etc..)  I went thru some of your code trying to see what this tool will be able to do n it got me excited!  (I even went to ForgeCurser.com and Android Developer trying to see what all the issues you're having... Gods speed you're doing something very amazing)\r\nBut if your making a tool for Android to make it be able to use Java tools? That's Right, right? Lol Sorry new 2 code but I love it how u make things outta random letters etc.\r\n(I use to make mod menus for Cod4, mw2 and Mw3 on my regular non jailbroken ps3 just had a USB n little pc size of my right hand(*Im 23 now*) then I got a Dex n could do anything with a Dex ps3.. sold accounts and bought my online brother a Rex Ps3 so we do anything lol.. So fun to code cus u can throw a little code n will let u do whatever.. but the best part of coding for myself was to watch your work turn into something from nothing..) but 1mod menu would take me a whole week for 3-4 pages of code for the ps3s way too much code n had to keep testing to see if it would even worked ughh. N Dex saved so much time live edit code etc no USB jus live updates. (( Sry for rambling.. I promise I'm trying to say I've been wanting a tool like this 1 for years now n glad to see your still working on it))\r\n\r\nBut if u are making an Android pe tool to use PC Java tools I really hope you and your team can add in World Paint to this app or something least similar (where u can build your world totally custom) Bcus the Mcpe Maps suck horribly they're always like repeating the same messed up chunk over n over..

wanted","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["Here is an overview of my research\n\n# \uD83C\uDFC6 Chosen PDF Library: WeasyPrint\n\n\n## At a Glance — Usage & Community Stats\n\n### WeasyPrint\n----------\n- It has 7.6k [Github](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint) stars which implies that it is strong and mature.\n- It is also regularly [maintained](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint)\n- At the moment of writing this it has about 150 open issues on Github and it is regularly maintained as well judging from the last commits\n- It's pip installation statistics, [last month download](https://pypistats.org/packages/weasyprint) of ~ 4 million and a last week download of ~ 1 million\n- It has a [BSD 3-Clause License, license](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/main/LICENSE) which means it can be used in an open-source app as well.\n\n\n### fpdf2\n-----\n- It has about 1.2k Github stars of [fpdf2](https://github.com/py-pdf/fpdf2) so it is growing\n- At the moment of writing this it has about 50 open [issues](https://github.com/py-pdf/fpdf2/issues) on Github, and it is regularly maintained as well judging from the last commits\n-- It's [pip installation statistics](https://pypistats.org/packages/fpdf2) has a last month download of ~ 1 million and a last week download of ~ 480 thousand\n- It has a [LGPL license](https://github.com/py-pdf/fpdf2/blob/master/LICENSE) which means it can be used in an open-source app as well.\n\n### reportlab\n-----\n- Could not find the open source repo for this, so mean it might be [privately maintained by ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/support/), hence we are dependent on ReportLab directly for updates and changes\n- It has a high usage and it's [pip installation statistics](https://pypistats.org/packages/reportlab) has a last month download of ~ 6.8 million and a last week download of ~ 1.8 million\n- It has a BSD license which means we can use the open-source version for our open-source app\n\n## Developer Experience\n\n### WeasyPrint\n- Learning curve is relative, but genrally quite low since it builds layouts using HTML and CSS.\n- There is more control in terms of styling a page, because of CSS functionalites\n- Good support for images and different fonts even CDN hosted fonts (since it allows for HTML and CSS)\n- Allows for reusable templates (HTML, CSS)\n- Fit for different document styles\n\n### fpdf2\n- Allows for reusable templates\n- Seems to be better fit for tabular document styles, e.g invoices, etc\n- Styling is also done programmatically\n\n### reportlab\n- Learning curve is medium, as it not requires Python but also some coordinate geometry for positioning objects (text, images, etc) in PDFs\n- Allows for templating as well (with python functions) but might be more complicated as it coordinate geometry is required\n\n## Evaluation\nAfter evaluating the highlighted libraries above: including WeasyPrint, ReportLab, and FPDF2 for PDF generation libraries — I selected WeasyPrint as the most suitable tool for this project.\n\n\n## Why WeasyPrint Wins\n\n### HTML & CSS Styling\nLayouts, spacing, fonts, and positioning are all handled through familiar CSS, removing the need to calculate (x, y) coordinates or use low-level drawing APIs.\n\n### Modern Design Capabilities\nIt relies on web standards, WeasyPrint supports modern fonts, flexbox/grid layouts, circular images, and overlays — ideal for polished, presentation-style PDFs.\n\n### Clean and Maintainable Codebase\nIt is easy to build a reusable base HTML/CSS template and update it for different episodes. This keeps the layout consistent while simplifying future content updates.\n\n\nAfter evaluating popular open-source PDF generation libraries — including WeasyPrint, ReportLab, and FPDF2 — I selected WeasyPrint as the most suitable tool for this project.\n"]},{"title":"Azure Blob Storage Support","url":"https://github.com/tweag/credential-helper/issues/50","repositoryName":"tweag/credential-helper","description":"**Is your feature request related to a problem?

The leaderboard will be fun, engaging, and visually appealing while delivering in-depth insights. It should capture a wide range of statistics from GitHub (such as stars, forks, commits, pull requests, issues, etc.) and incorporate supplementary data (e.g., code quality scores, community engagement, social media influence, and external service integrations).\n\nFeature Details:\n\t•\tGitHub Metrics:\n\t•\tStars & Forks: Display real-time star and fork counts.\n\t•\tCommits & Pull Requests: Count recent commits and pull requests to indicate development activity.\n\t•\tIssues & Bug Reports: Monitor open vs. closed issues, average resolution time, etc.\n\t•\tReleases: Show latest release dates and version progression.\n\t•\tAdditional Statistics:\n\t•\tCode Quality: Integrate static analysis scores or code coverage reports from tools like SonarQube or Codecov.\n\t•\tCommunity Engagement: Track metrics such as contributor count, discussion activity, and recent community events.\n\t•\tSocial Media Influence: Incorporate data like Twitter mentions, LinkedIn followers, or blog traffic if available.\n\t•\tExternal Integrations: Optionally pull in metrics from related platforms (e.g., package downloads from npm, PyPI, or similar repositories).\n\t•\tLeaderboard Features:\n\t•\tVisual Presentation:\n\t•\tA dynamic, animated leaderboard with progress bars, badges, and graphs.\n\t•\tEach project entry displays its logo, name, and key stats at a glance.\n\t•\tFun animations to highlight significant changes (e.g., a project overtaking another or achieving a milestone).\n\t•\tFiltering & Sorting:\n\t•\tUsers can filter projects by category, language, or organization.\n\t•\tSorting options based on various metrics (e.g., most stars, best code quality, highest community engagement).\n\t•\tUser Interaction:\n\t•\tHover effects or tooltips that reveal deeper insights.\n\t•\tOptions for users to “favorite” projects or view detailed profiles.\n\t•\tResponsive Design:\n\t•\tOptimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.\n\t•\tData Aggregation & Refresh:\n\t•\tThe leaderboard should update periodically (or in real time, if feasible) by pulling data from:\n\t•\tGitHub APIs for core repository metrics.\n\t•\tExternal services for code quality, community metrics, and social media influence.\n\t•\tCaching strategies may be implemented to ensure performance and avoid API rate limits.\n\t•\tTechnology Stack:\n\t•\tBackend: Django (or similar framework) to manage data aggregation, caching, and API integrations.\n\t•\tFrontend: A modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or plain HTML5/CSS3 with animations) for an engaging, real-time UI.\n\t•\tDatabase: PostgreSQL (or a comparable database) to store project metrics and historical data for trend analysis.\n\nAI Agent Coding Instructions:\n\nYou are an AI-assisted coder tasked with building an engaging project leaderboard for our GitHub repository/project statistics. Your responsibilities include:\n\n1. **Repository & Data Integration:**\n   - Clone and set up the repository.\n   - Integrate with the GitHub API to fetch essential project metrics (stars, forks, commits, pull requests, issues, and releases).\n   - Integrate with external services (or simulate data) for additional stats such as code quality, community engagement, and social media influence.\n   - Implement caching strategies to manage API rate limits and ensure fast data retrieval.\n\n2. **Backend Development:**\n   - Create a Django app (e.g., \"leaderboard\") to aggregate and process the data.\n   - Develop models to store the project metrics and historical data.\n   - Build scheduled tasks (using Celery or Django's built-in scheduler) for periodic data updates.\n   - Expose RESTful endpoints or WebSocket connections to provide real-time data to the frontend.\n\n3. **Frontend Development:**\n   - Design a responsive, animated leaderboard interface using a modern JavaScript framework or Django templates enhanced with JavaScript.\n   - Display project entries with logos, names, and key statistics in an engaging format (e.g., animated progress bars, graphs, badges).\n   - Implement filtering, sorting, and hover effects for detailed insights.\n   - Ensure smooth transitions and fun animations when leaderboard rankings update.\n\n4. **Testing & Validation:**\n   - Write unit tests for the backend data processing and API integrations.\n   - Create integration tests to verify that data flows correctly from the backend to the frontend.\n   - Validate the responsiveness and usability of the leaderboard UI.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Document the leaderboard architecture, configuration options, and data sources.\n   - Provide inline code comments and update the README with setup instructions and usage examples.\n   - Outline how to adjust the data refresh intervals and add new metrics if needed.\n\nGenerate the scaffolding code, including models, views, templates, API endpoints, and unit tests for this project leaderboard feature.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\t1.\tData Aggregation:\n\t•\tThe leaderboard successfully fetches and displays a wide range of GitHub metrics along with additional external statistics.\n\t•\tData refreshes periodically without manual intervention.\n\t2.\tVisual & Interactive Interface:\n\t•\tThe leaderboard presents project stats in a fun, engaging, and visually appealing manner.\n\t•\tAnimations and interactions (e.g., tooltips, filtering, sorting) work smoothly across devices.\n\t3.\tReal-Time Updates:\n\t•\tThe leaderboard reflects changes in metrics promptly (using either real-time updates via WebSockets or frequent polling).\n\t•\tSignificant metric changes are highlighted with animations.\n\t4.\tCode Quality & Testing:\n\t•\tThe implementation follows coding standards, with clear documentation and inline comments.\n\t•\tUnit and integration tests cover key functionality, ensuring reliability and maintainability.\n\t5.\tExtensibility:\n\t•\tThe design allows for easy addition of new metrics or integration with additional data sources in the future.","updatedAt":"2025-03-18T17:41:09Z","user":"DonnieBLT","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/DonnieBLT","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128622481?v=4","labels":["$5","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["@DonnieBLT \n this idea is going to be for GSoC, right?

Here's what I've implemented:\n\n1. **Main View and API Endpoints**:\n   - Created `website/views/project_leaderboard.py` with the main view and API endpoints\n   - Added filtering by project status and organization\n   - Implemented sorting by various metrics (stars, forks, issues, contributors)\n\n2. **User Interface**:\n   - Built a responsive template with both table and card views of projects\n   - Added interactive stats refreshing with HTMX\n   - Included visual indicators for project status\n   - Implemented real-time notifications for user actions\n\n3. **Data Management**:\n   - Created a management command to sync project stats from GitHub\n   - Added a template filter for calculating aggregate repository metrics\n   - Designed API endpoints for dynamic data updates\n\n4. **Repository Model**:\n   - Noted that a Repository model needs to be created (code provided)\n\nThe implementation uses HTML5 and HTMX (no React as requested) and will be available at the `/project_leaderboard` path.\n\n**Next steps to finalize implementation:**\n\n1. Add the Repository model to your models.py file\n2. Add the URL patterns to blt/urls.py \n3. Run migrations for the new model\n4. Import the views in your URL configuration\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments to the implementation!","@nitinawari use it for everything ","@DonnieBLT What did Coderabbit just do now?

Update URLs Configuration\n- Add the following imports to `blt/urls.py`:\n```python\nfrom website.views.project_leaderboard import ProjectLeaderboardView, project_leaderboard_data, refresh_project_stats\n```\n\n- Add these URL patterns to the `urlpatterns` list:\n```python\npath('project_leaderboard/', ProjectLeaderboardView.as_view(), name='project_leaderboard'),\npath('project_leaderboard/data/', project_leaderboard_data, name='project_leaderboard_data'),\npath('project_leaderboard/refresh/<int:project_id>/', refresh_project_stats, name='refresh_project_stats'),\n```\n\n### 3. Install Required Dependencies\n- Make sure HTMX is loaded in your templates\n\n### 4. Run Management Command\nTo initially populate repository stats, run:\n\n\n### 5. Add a Scheduled Task (Optional)\nFor automatic updates, add a scheduled task to run `sync_project_stats` periodically.\n\n## GitHub API Rate Limits\nNote that GitHub API has rate limits.

Let me check the project structure more carefully to provide a correct implementation.\n\n\nbash\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\n### 5. Initialize GitHub Repository Data (Optional)\n\nIf you want to populate initial data for existing projects, you can:\n\n1. Manually create Repository records for your projects\n2. Run the sync command to pull GitHub stats:\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Comprehensive GitHub Metrics**: Stars, forks, issues, and contributors\n- **Filtering and Sorting**: Filter by project status or organization, sort by different metrics\n- **Interactive UI**: Refresh stats and real-time updates with HTMX\n- **Responsive Design**: Looks good on desktop and mobile\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If you encounter GitHub API rate limits, configure a GitHub token in your settings:\n  ```python\n  # settings.py\n  GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_github_token_here'\n  ```\n- For large projects with many repositories, consider implementing a Celery task for background processing\nEOF\n\n# Display the created files\necho \"Files created successfully:\"\nls -la website/templates/project_leaderboard.html website/templatetags/project_extras.py website/views/project_leaderboard.py website/management/commands/sync_project_stats.py website/models.py.append urls_patch.txt README_project_leaderboard.md\n```\n\n\n\n@DonnieBLT I've created the complete code for the project leaderboard feature! Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## Implementation Files\n\n1. **Template**: `website/templates/project_leaderboard.html`\n   - Responsive design with filtering, sorting, and both table and card views\n\n2. **Views**: `website/views/project_leaderboard.py`\n   - Main leaderboard view with API endpoints for data filtering and stat refreshing\n\n3. **Template Tag**: `website/templatetags/project_extras.py`\n   - Custom filter for calculating repository statistics\n\n4. **Repository Model**: Addition to `website/models.py`\n   - Model for storing GitHub metrics (stars, forks, issues, etc.)\n\n5. **Management Command**: `website/management/commands/sync_project_stats.py`\n   - Command to update GitHub stats from the API\n\n6. **URL Configuration**: `urls_patch.txt`\n   - URL patterns to add to your main urls.py file\n\n7. **Installation Guide**: `README_project_leaderboard.md`\n   - Step-by-step instructions for implementation\n\n## Features\n\n- **GitHub Metrics**: Stars, forks, open issues, and contributors\n- **Interactive UI**: HTMX-powered filtering, sorting, and stat refreshing\n- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile\n- **Visual Indicators**: Status badges and visual stat displays\n\n## Installation Steps\n\n1. Add the provided files to your project\n2. Append the Repository model to your existing models.py\n3. Add URL patterns to blt/urls.py\n4. Run migrations\n5. Optionally initialize data with the sync_project_stats command\n\nThe leaderboard will be available at `/project_leaderboard` as requested.\n\nAll code has been tested for syntax and follows Django best practices. The README contains detailed implementation instructions.\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check directory structure for models to understand how to implement repository model\necho \"Checking directory structure for models...\"\nfind ./website -name \"models*\" -type d || find ./website -type f -name \"models.py\"\n\n# Check if we need to modify existing models or create a new one\necho -e \"\\nChecking main models.py file...\"\nfind ./website -name \"models.py\" | head -1 | xargs grep -n \"class Repository\" || echo \"Repository model doesn't exist yet\"\n\n# Check project URLs to see how patterns are registered\necho -e \"\\nChecking URL patterns format...\"\nfind ./blt -name \"urls.py\" | head -1 | xargs grep -A5 -B5 \"path(\" | head -20\n```\n\nLength of output: 1461\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Generate complete implementation files for the project leaderboard feature\n\n# 1.

Add Files to the Project\n\nCopy all the provided files to the appropriate locations in your project structure.\n\n### 2. Add Repository Model\n\nAdd the Repository model to your models.py file. You can append the content from `website/models.py.append` to your existing models file.\n\n### 3. Update URL Configuration\n\nAdd the new URL patterns from `urls_patch.txt` to your `blt/urls.py` file.\n\n### 4. Run Migrations\n\nGenerate and apply migrations for the new Repository model:\n\n```\n\nLength of output: 314\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\npython manage.py sync_project_stats\n```\n\nLength of output: 242\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n@DonnieBLT I've created the complete implementation for the project leaderboard feature. Here's what you need to know:\n\n## Files Created\n\n1. **Template**: `website/templates/project_leaderboard.html`\n   - Responsive design with filtering and sorting options\n   - Table view and card view for projects\n   - HTMX integration for dynamic updates\n\n2. **Views**: `website/views/project_leaderboard.py`\n   - Main view class and API endpoints\n   - Data filtering and sorting capabilities\n   - Stats refresh functionality\n\n3. **Template Tag**: `website/templatetags/project_extras.py`\n   - Helper filter for calculating aggregate stats\n\n4. **Repository Model**: Add to `website/models.py`\n   - Model to store GitHub repository metrics\n\n5. **Management Command**: `website/management/commands/sync_project_stats.py`\n   - Command to fetch and update GitHub stats\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Add the Repository Model\nAdd this to the end of your `website/models.py` file:\n\n```python\nclass Repository(models.Model):\n    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='repos')\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    url = models.URLField()\n    description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)\n    stars = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    forks = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    open_issues = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    watchers = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    \n    class Meta:\n        verbose_name_plural = \"Repositories\"\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n```\n\n### 2. Add URL Routes\nAdd these imports and URL patterns to your `blt/urls.py` file:\n\n```python\nfrom website.views.project_leaderboard import ProjectLeaderboardView, project_leaderboard_data, refresh_project_stats\n\n# Add these to urlpatterns\npath('project_leaderboard/', ProjectLeaderboardView.as_view(), name='project_leaderboard'),\npath('project_leaderboard/data/', project_leaderboard_data, name='project_leaderboard_data'),\npath('project_leaderboard/refresh/<int:project_id>/', refresh_project_stats, name='refresh_project_stats'),\n```\n\n### 3. Run Migrations\nAfter adding the Repository model:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\n### 4. Initialize Data (Optional)\nTo populate initial repository data:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py sync_project_stats\n```\n\n## Features Implemented\n\n- **Comprehensive GitHub Metrics**: Stars, forks, issues, and contributors\n- **Interactive UI**: HTMX-powered filtering, sorting, and data refreshing\n- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile\n- **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges for project status\n- **Multi-view Display**: Both table and card views for different use cases\n\nAll the code follows Django best practices and is integrated with your existing models.

First, I need to examine the current implementation to understand how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to locate more specific information about the repo_list implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to continue searching for the relevant repo_list files.\n\n\n\n\nLet me try a different approach to find the repo_list implementation.\n\n\n\n\nLet me look for any repository list or collection views.\n\n\n\n\nLet me look for specifically the repository list or repo_list in the URLs.\n\n\n\n\nI need to modify my approach to find relevant files.\n\n\n\n\nLet me try to find any repository-related views using a more targeted approach.\n\n\n\n\nLet me create a more comprehensive search to find the repository list functionality.\n\n\n\n\nLet me look for any other repo or repository in view files.\n\n\n\n\nI need to check for recent changes or additions related to repositories or projects.\n\n\n\n\nLet me examine the files created in the earlier implementation in case they are relevant.\n\n\n\n\nLet me check for specific URL patterns.\n\n\n\n\nSince I'm having difficulty finding the repo_list implementation, let me try a more targeted approach based on what I know about the OWASP BLT project.\n\n\n\n\nSince I'm not finding the explicit repo_list implementation, I'll work with the available information to create the solution.\n\n\n\n\nBased on my research, I'm not finding a direct reference to a `/repo_list` endpoint or implementation. The issue might be referring to a feature that exists by a different name, or it might be asking to create this as a new enhancement.\n\nGiven the PR objectives and the comment chain, I'll proceed to create an enhancement for a repository list page that meets the criteria specified in the issue. I'll use the models and structure I could identify from the codebase.\n\n\n\n\nLet me look at the existing project structure and templates to better understand how to implement the enhancement.\n\n\n\n\nBased on my research, I haven't found a specific `/repo_list` implementation in the provided codebase. However, I can create an enhancement that satisfies the requirements in the issue. I'll implement a comprehensive repository leaderboard view that will display GitHub metrics and additional statistics.\n\nI'll now create the necessary files for this enhancement:\n\n\n\n\nNow I'll provide a summary of the implementation:\n\n@DonnieBLT I've created an enhancement for the existing `/repo_list` page that meets the criteria specified in the issue. Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## Repository Leaderboard Enhancement\n\n### Features Added:\n\n1. **Comprehensive GitHub Metrics Dashboard**\n   - Shows total stars, forks, issues, and repository counts\n   - Visual progress indicators for each metric\n\n2. **Advanced Filtering System**\n   - Filter by project\n   - Filter by minimum stars/forks threshold\n   - Multiple sorting options (stars, forks, issues, name, last updated)\n   - Direction control (ascending/descending)\n\n3. **Dual View Display**\n   - Table view with detailed repository information\n   - Card view for featured repositories with at-a-glance metrics\n\n4. **Real-time Stat Updates**\n   - Individual repository stat refresh functionality\n   - Bulk refresh option for all repositories\n   - HTMX integration for smooth, animated updates\n   - Notification system for user feedback\n\n### Implementation Files:\n\n1. **View File**: `website/views/repo_leaderboard.py`\n   - Contains `RepoListView` class that handles filtering and sorting\n   - API endpoint for repository stat refreshing\n\n2. **Template**: `website/templates/repo_leaderboard.html`\n   - Responsive design with mobile and desktop support\n   - Interactive filtering and sorting interface\n   - Visually engaging presentation of metrics\n\n3. **URL Configuration**:\n   - Maintains the existing `/repo_list/` endpoint\n   - Adds a new endpoint for stat refreshing\n\n### Installation:\n\nTo integrate this enhancement:\n\n1. Add the view file to your codebase\n2. Add the template file to your templates directory\n3. Update your URL configuration to include the new patterns\n4. Ensure your Repository model has the necessary fields (stars, forks, open_issues, last_updated)\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Check for repo_list URL and view\necho \"Checking URL patterns for repo_list...\"\nfind . -name \"urls.py\" | xargs grep -l

Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## Enhanced Repository Leaderboard\n\n### Features Added:\n\n1. **Statistics Dashboard**\n   - Shows total repos, stars, forks, and open issues\n   - Includes visual progress indicators for each metric\n\n2. **Advanced Filtering System**\n   - Filter by project \n   - Filter by minimum stars/forks threshold\n   - Comprehensive sorting options (stars, forks, issues, name, last updated)\n   - Direction controls (ascending/descending)\n\n3. **Improved Repository Display**\n   - Enhanced table view with visual metric indicators\n   - Added card view for featured repositories\n   - Clear visual hierarchy and information organization\n\n4. **Real-time Updates**\n   - Individual repository stat refresh functionality\n   - Bulk refresh option for all repositories\n   - HTMX integration for smooth updates\n   - Notification system for user feedback\n\n### Implementation Files:\n\n1. **View File**: `website/views/repo_leaderboard.py`\n   - Replacement for the existing RepoListView\n   - Enhanced with additional context data and filtering\n\n2. **Template**: `website/templates/repo_leaderboard.html`\n   - Responsive design for all devices\n   - Modern UI with dashboard, filtering, table and card views\n\n3. **URL Configuration**:\n   - Uses the existing `/repo_list/` endpoint\n   - Adds a refresh endpoint for repository stats\n\n### Integration Steps:\n\n1. Replace the existing `website/views/repo.py` RepoListView with the enhanced implementation\n2. Replace the template at `website/templates/repo/repo_list.html` with the new one\n3. Update the URL configuration to include the refresh endpoint\n\nThis enhancement maintains the existing URL structure while significantly improving the functionality and visual appeal of the repository list page, making it a comprehensive leaderboard as specified in the issue.","@coderabbitai You don't need to replace the existing /repo_list view. Instead, use it as a reference to list the repositories. Then, enhance the /project_leaderboard and its view by incorporating additional features from the issue description. You should utilize the existing repo/project models and focus on making the leaderboard more engaging and visually appealing.

Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## Project Leaderboard Implementation\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Comprehensive GitHub Metrics**\n   - Aggregated repository metrics (stars, forks, issues)\n   - Project status visualizations\n   - Card and table views for varied data consumption\n\n2. **Interactive Data Visualization**\n   - Dynamic charts showing top projects by stars\n   - Status distribution chart using a doughnut visualization\n   - Animated stats counters and progress bars\n\n3. **Advanced UI Components**\n   - Smooth animations for engagement (hover effects, scroll animations)\n   - Real-time stat refreshing with loading indicators \n   - Toast notification system for user feedback\n\n4. **Powerful Filtering & Sorting**\n   - Filter by organization and project status\n   - Sort by multiple metrics (stars, forks, issues, commits, name, dates)\n   - Ascending/descending sort direction\n\n### Files Created:\n1. **View**: `website/views/project_leaderboard.py`\n2. **Template**: `website/templates/projects/project_leaderboard.html`\n3. **URL Configuration**: See `url_patch.txt` for adding to `urls.py`\n\n### Implemented Technologies:\n- Chart.js for data visualization\n- CSS animations and transitions for engagement\n- Responsive design for all devices\n- AJAX for asynchronous stat refreshing\n\n### Integration Steps:\n1. Add the URL patterns from `url_patch.txt` to your `blt/urls.py` file\n2. Ensure the `Repo` model has the required fields (stars, forks, open_issues)\n\nThis implementation maintains the existing repo/project models while creating a visually engaging leaderboard that meets all the requirements in the issue description.","@coderabbitai  what is the use of project_leaderboard/data/ route it just shows data not any frontend UI for it ","<!-- This is an auto-generated reply by CodeRabbit -->\n> [!TIP]\n> For best results, initiate chat on the files or code changes.\n\n@nitinawari The `project_leaderboard/data/` route is an API endpoint that returns project data in JSON format instead of HTML. Its primary purposes are:\n\n1. **Dynamic Filtering & Sorting** - This endpoint allows the frontend to request filtered or sorted data without reloading the entire page. This creates a smoother user experience when users change filters or sorting options.\n\n2. **HTMX Integration** - It can be used with HTMX to update just the project table/cards when filters change, rather than reloading the whole page.\n\n3. **Frontend Interactivity** - Provides data for Chart.js visualizations and dynamic UI updates.\n\n4. **External Consumption** - Makes project data available to other applications or services that might need it.\n\nWhile I didn't explicitly connect all the frontend JavaScript to use this endpoint (that's why you don't see a UI for it directly), it's there as part of a complete implementation that follows best practices for separating data from presentation. You could enhance the implementation by using fetch/AJAX calls to this endpoint for real-time data updates.","@coderabbitai working the solution now let's include more features from the issue description ","<!-- This is an auto-generated reply by CodeRabbit -->\n> [!TIP]\n> For best results, initiate chat on the files or code changes.\n\n@nitinawari I'll help you implement more features from the issue description. Let's enhance the project leaderboard with these additional components:\n\n## 1. Additional GitHub Metrics\n\nLet's add commits, pull requests, and releases tracking:\n\n```python\n# Add to project_leaderboard.py view\ndef get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\n    context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)\n    \n    # ... existing code ...\n    \n    # Add additional GitHub metrics\n    for project in projects:\n        repos = project.repos.all()\n        project.total_commits = sum(repo.commit_count if hasattr(repo, 'commit_count') else 0 for repo in repos)\n        project.total_pull_requests = sum(repo.pull_requests if hasattr(repo, 'pull_requests') else 0 for repo in repos)\n        project.total_releases = sum(repo.releases if hasattr(repo, 'releases') else 0 for repo in repos)\n        \n        # Calculate activity score based on recent commits and PRs\n        project.activity_score = (project.total_commits * 0.5) + (project.total_pull_requests * 0.3) + (project.total_stars * 0.2)\n        \n    # ... rest of the function ...\n```\n\n## 2. Code Quality Integration\n\nAdd code quality metrics from services like SonarQube or Codecov:\n\n```python\n# Add to models.py\nclass CodeQualityMetrics(models.Model):\n    project = models.OneToOneField(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='code_quality')\n    coverage = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)\n    bugs = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    vulnerabilities = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    code_smells = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    last_analysis = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Code Quality for {self.project.name}\"\n```\n\n## 3. Tooltips and Enhanced Interactivity\n\nAdd tooltips to the leaderboard template:\n\n```html\n<!-- Add this to your template's JavaScript section -->\n<script>\n  // Initialize tooltips\n  const tooltipTriggerList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"]')\n  const tooltipList = [...tooltipTriggerList].map(tooltipTriggerEl => new bootstrap.Tooltip(tooltipTriggerEl))\n  \n  // Add favorite functionality\n  document.querySelectorAll('.favorite-btn').forEach(button => {\n    button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n      const projectId = this.getAttribute('data-project-id');\n      \n      fetch(`/project_leaderboard/favorite/${projectId}/`, {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n          'X-CSRFToken': getCookie('csrftoken'),\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n        }\n      })\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        if (data.status === 'success') {\n          this.classList.toggle('favorited');\n          showNotification(data.message, 'success');\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n## 4. Background Data Aggregation\n\nCreate a Celery task for periodic updates:\n\n```python\n# Create tasks.py file\nfrom celery import shared_task\nimport requests\nimport logging\n\n@shared_task\ndef update_project_github_stats():\n    from website.models import Project\n    \n    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n    logger.info(\"Starting GitHub stats update\")\n    \n    projects = Project.objects.all()\n    for project in projects:\n        try:\n            update_project_repositories(project)\n            logger.info(f\"Updated stats for project {project.name}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Failed to update stats for {project.name}: {str(e)}\")\n    \n    return f\"Updated GitHub stats for {projects.count()} projects\"\n\ndef update_project_repositories(project):\n    for repo in project.repos.all():\n        # Skip if not a GitHub repo\n        if not repo.url or 'github.com' not in repo.url:\n            continue\n            \n        # Extract owner/repo from URL\n        parts = repo.url.rstrip('/').split('/')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n            \n        owner_repo = '/'.join(parts[-2:])\n        \n        # Update repo stats\n        update_repo_metrics(repo, owner_repo)\n        update_repo_contributors(repo, owner_repo)\n        update_repo_commits(repo, owner_repo)\n        update_repo_releases(repo, owner_repo)\n```\n\n## 5. Social Media Integration \n\nAdd social media metrics:\n\n```python\n# Add to models.py\nclass SocialMediaMetrics(models.Model):\n    project = models.OneToOneField(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='social_metrics')\n    twitter_mentions = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    twitter_followers = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    linkedin_mentions = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    blog_posts = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Social Media Metrics for {self.project.name}\"\n```\n\n## 6. Enhanced Visualizations\n\nAdd time-series charts to track metrics over time:\n\n```html\n<!-- Add to your template -->\n<div class=\"bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-6 animate-on-scroll\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Activity Over Time</h3>\n    <canvas id=\"activityTimelineChart\" height=\"300\"></canvas>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Add to your JavaScript -->\n<script>\n    // Activity timeline chart\n    const activityCtx = document.getElementById('activityTimelineChart').getContext('2d');\n    const activityChart = new Chart(activityCtx, {\n        type: 'line',\n        data: {\n            labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],\n            datasets: [{\n                label: 'Commits',\n                data: [65, 78, 90, 81, 56, 55, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90],\n                borderColor: 'rgb(59, 130, 246)',\n                backgroundColor: 'rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1)',\n                tension: 0.4,\n                fill: true\n            }, {\n                label: 'Pull Requests',\n                data: [28, 48, 40, 19, 86, 27, 90, 60, 30, 40, 50, 70],\n                borderColor: 'rgb(16, 185, 129)',\n                backgroundColor: 'rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1)',\n                tension: 0.4,\n                fill: true\n            }]\n        },\n        options: {\n            responsive: true,\n            plugins: {\n                legend: {\n                    position: 'top',\n                },\n                title: {\n                    display: true,\n                    text: 'Project Activity Timeline'\n                }\n            },\n            scales: {\n                y: {\n                    beginAtZero: true\n                }\n            },\n            animation: {\n                duration: 2000,\n                easing: 'easeOutQuart'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n## 7. Package Repository Integration\n\nTrack downloads from package repositories:\n\n```python\n# Add to models.py\nclass PackageMetrics(models.Model):\n    project = models.OneToOneField(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='package_metrics')\n    package_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    repository_type = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=[\n        ('npm', 'NPM'),\n        ('pypi', 'PyPI'),\n        ('maven', 'Maven'),\n        ('nuget', 'NuGet'),\n    ])\n    total_downloads = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    monthly_downloads = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    weekly_downloads = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.package_name} ({self.get_repository_type_display()})\"\n```\n\nThese features will significantly enhance your project leaderboard with more comprehensive GitHub metrics, code quality data, social media integration, package statistics, and improved visualizations.

description. I've created a comprehensive implementation with the expanded repository model, caching strategies, and all required features:\n\n## 1. Expanded Repository Model\n\n```python\nclass Repository(models.Model):\n    # Basic Fields\n    project = models.ForeignKey('Project', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='repos')\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    url = models.URLField()\n    description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)\n    \n    # GitHub Metrics\n    stars = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    forks = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    open_issues = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    watchers = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    \n    # Enhanced GitHub Metrics\n    total_issues = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    closed_issues = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    pull_requests = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    open_pull_requests = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    merged_pull_requests = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    contributors_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    commits_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    recent_commits = models.IntegerField(default=0)  # Last 30 days\n    \n    # Release Information\n    latest_release = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\n    latest_release_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    releases_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    \n    # Code Quality Metrics\n    code_coverage = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)  # Percentage\n    code_quality_score = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)  # 0-100\n    vulnerabilities = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    maintainability_index = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)\n    \n    # Community Engagement\n    discussions_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    recent_discussions = models.IntegerField(default=0)  # Last 30 days\n    \n    # Social Media Metrics\n    twitter_mentions = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    linkedin_mentions = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    social_engagement_score = models.FloatField(default=0)\n    \n    # External Package Stats\n    package_downloads = models.IntegerField(default=0)  # NPM, PyPI, etc.\n    recent_package_downloads = models.IntegerField(default=0)  # Last 30 days\n    \n    # Cache Management\n    last_github_sync = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    last_quality_sync = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    last_social_sync = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    last_package_sync = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\n```\n\n## 2. Caching Strategy Implementation\n\nI've implemented a robust caching system with Celery tasks for background processing:\n\n```python\n# Caching configuration in settings.py\nCACHES = {\n    'default': {\n        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyMemcacheCache',\n        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',\n    }\n}\n\n# Cache TTL configurations\nGITHUB_CACHE_TTL = 3600  # 1 hour\nQUALITY_CACHE_TTL = 86400  # 24 hours\nSOCIAL_CACHE_TTL = 43200  # 12 hours\nPACKAGE_CACHE_TTL = 86400  # 24 hours\nCONTEXT_CACHE_TTL = 600  # 10 minutes\n```\n\n## 3. Background Processing with Celery\n\nImplemented tasks for fetching and updating all the requested metrics:\n\n```python\n@shared_task\ndef sync_github_data(repo_id):\n    \"\"\"Sync repository data from GitHub API with caching\"\"\"\n    # Implementation fetches stars, forks, issues, PRs, contributors, commits, releases\n    \n@shared_task\ndef sync_code_quality(repo_id):\n    \"\"\"Sync code quality metrics from services like Codecov, SonarQube, etc.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation fetches code quality scores, coverage reports, vulnerabilities\n    \n@shared_task\ndef sync_social_media(repo_id):\n    \"\"\"Sync social media mentions and influence metrics\"\"\"\n    # Implementation fetches Twitter mentions, LinkedIn engagements\n    \n@shared_task\ndef sync_package_downloads(repo_id):\n    \"\"\"Sync package download statistics from npm, PyPI, etc.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation fetches download stats from relevant package managers\n```\n\n## 4. Visual Leaderboard with Interactive Elements\n\nThe leaderboard view includes:\n\n1. **Metric Dashboard** - Shows aggregate stats for all projects\n2. **Interactive Charts** - Data visualizations for stars, forks, code quality, etc.\n3. **Activity Timeline** - Shows recent project activity\n4. **Filtering & Sorting** - Advanced filtering by multiple criteria\n5. **Real-time Refresh** - AJAX/HTMX updates without page reloads\n6. **Animations** - Visual transitions and counters\n7. **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices\n\n## 5. Leaderboard Features\n\n- **GitHub Metrics**: Stars, forks, issues, PRs, commits and releases with real-time updates\n- **Code Quality**: Integration with SonarQube/Codecov for quality metrics\n- **Community Engagement**: Contributor counts, discussion tracking\n- **Social Media Influence**: Twitter/LinkedIn mention tracking\n- **External Integrations**: Package downloads from npm, PyPI, etc.\n\n## Implementation Instructions:\n\n1. Add the enhanced Repository model to your database\n2. Set up caching with Memcached or Redis\n3. Configure Celery for background processing\n4. Implement the view and templates\n5. Set up scheduled tasks to keep data fresh\n\nWould you like me to provide the complete code for any specific component, or would you like more details on the implementation?\n\n(\\_/)\n(•ᴗ•)\n/ >\uD83D\uDCCA Ready to implement this comprehensive dashboard!","@coderabbitai looking good let's provide the frontend code for all of this also don't use CSS only HTML5 and tailwind CSS ","<!-- This is an auto-generated reply by CodeRabbit -->\n> [!TIP]\n> For best results, initiate chat on the files or code changes.\n\n@nitinawari Great!

Based on your feedback, the tabs are visible but they're not properly showing different content - they're all showing the same data.\n\nLet's identify and fix the issue. There are a few common reasons why tabs might not be working correctly:\n\n\n\n\nThe issue is likely in how the tab content elements are structured or in the JavaScript handling the tab switching. Here's a fixed implementation:\n\n1. First, make sure each tab content div has the correct ID format:\n\n```html\n<!-- Example correct tab content structure -->\n<div id=\"tab-dashboard\" class=\"tab-content active\">\n  <!-- Dashboard content -->\n</div>\n<div id=\"tab-projects\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n  <!-- Projects content -->\n</div>\n<div id=\"tab-quality\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n  <!-- Quality content -->\n</div>\n<div id=\"tab-activity\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n  <!-- Activity content -->\n</div>\n```\n\n2. Check the JavaScript function that handles tab switching:\n\n```javascript\nfunction initTabs() {\n    const tabButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.tab-button');\n    const tabContents = document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content');\n    \n    // Set first tab as active by default\n    if (tabButtons.length > 0 && tabContents.length > 0) {\n        tabButtons[0].classList.add('border-blue-500', 'text-blue-600');\n        tabContents[0].classList.remove('hidden');\n        tabContents[0].classList.add('active');\n    }\n    \n    tabButtons.forEach(button => {\n        button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n            // Remove active class from all buttons and contents\n            tabButtons.forEach(btn => {\n                btn.classList.remove('border-blue-500', 'text-blue-600');\n                btn.classList.add('border-transparent', 'text-gray-500');\n            });\n            \n            tabContents.forEach(content => {\n                content.classList.add('hidden');\n                content.classList.remove('active');\n            });\n            \n            // Add active class to clicked button and corresponding content\n            this.classList.add('border-blue-500', 'text-blue-600');\n            this.classList.remove('border-transparent', 'text-gray-500');\n            \n            const tabId = this.getAttribute('data-tab');\n            const activeContent = document.getElementById(`tab-${tabId}`);\n            if (activeContent) {\n                activeContent.classList.remove('hidden');\n                activeContent.classList.add('active');\n                \n                // Force re-render of charts in the active tab if needed\n                if (tabId === 'dashboard' && typeof initDashboardCharts === 'function') {\n                    initDashboardCharts();\n                } else if (tabId === 'quality' && typeof initQualityCharts === 'function') {\n                    initQualityCharts();\n                } else if (tabId === 'activity' && typeof initActivityCharts === 'function') {\n                    initActivityCharts();\n                } else if (tabId === 'social' && typeof initSocialCharts === 'function') {\n                    initSocialCharts();\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\n3. Also ensure the CSS properly handles tab content visibility by adding these Tailwind classes:\n\n```html\n<!-- In your template's head section -->\n<style>\n  .tab-content {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  .tab-content.active {\n    display: block;\n    animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out;\n  }\n  @keyframes fadeIn {\n    from { opacity: 0; }\n    to { opacity: 1; }\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\nOr if you're using pure Tailwind:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"tab-dashboard\" class=\"block tab-content active\">\n  <!-- Dashboard content -->\n</div>\n<div id=\"tab-projects\" class=\"hidden tab-content\">\n  <!-- Projects content -->\n</div>\n```\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to provide a completely updated implementation of the tab system, or if you need help with specific sections of the code!\n\n---\n\n\uD83C\uDFC1 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Let's check the current HTML structure to identify potential tab issues\n# Assuming your project_leaderboard.html is in the templates directory\nfind . -name \"project_leaderboard.html\" | xargs grep -A5 \"tab-content\" | head -20\n```\n\nLength of output: 79\n\n---\n\n@nitinawari I'll help you fix the tab functionality issue.

Let me provide a proper tab implementation that will fix the issue.\n\nThe problem is likely that all your tab content divs are visible simultaneously rather than showing only the active tab. Here's a corrected implementation:\n\n### 1. HTML Structure Fix\n\nMake sure your tab content divs follow this structure:\n\n```html\n<!-- Tab Buttons -->\n<div class=\"mb-6 border-b border-gray-200\">\n    <nav class=\"flex flex-wrap -mb-px\">\n        <button class=\"tab-button px-4 py-2 border-b-2 border-blue-500 text-blue-600 font-medium\" data-tab=\"dashboard\">Dashboard</button>\n        <button class=\"tab-button px-4 py-2 border-b-2 border-transparent text-gray-500 font-medium\" data-tab=\"projects\">Projects</button>\n        <button class=\"tab-button px-4 py-2 border-b-2 border-transparent text-gray-500 font-medium\" data-tab=\"quality\">Quality</button>\n        <button class=\"tab-button px-4 py-2 border-b-2 border-transparent text-gray-500 font-medium\" data-tab=\"activity\">Activity</button>\n        <button class=\"tab-button px-4 py-2 border-b-2 border-transparent text-gray-500 font-medium\" data-tab=\"social\">Social</button>\n    </nav>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Tab Content -->\n<div>\n    <!-- Dashboard Tab Content - Initially visible -->\n    <div id=\"tab-dashboard\" class=\"tab-content block\">\n        <!-- Dashboard content -->\n    </div>\n    \n    <!-- Projects Tab Content - Initially hidden -->\n    <div id=\"tab-projects\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n        <!-- Projects content -->\n    </div>\n    \n    <!-- Quality Tab Content - Initially hidden -->\n    <div id=\"tab-quality\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n        <!-- Quality content -->\n    </div>\n    \n    <!-- Activity Tab Content - Initially hidden -->\n    <div id=\"tab-activity\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n        <!-- Activity content -->\n    </div>\n    \n    <!-- Social Tab Content - Initially hidden -->\n    <div id=\"tab-social\" class=\"tab-content hidden\">\n        <!-- Social content -->\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### 2. JavaScript Fix\n\nReplace your current `initTabs` function with this implementation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction initTabs() {\n    const tabButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.tab-button');\n    const tabContents = document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content');\n    \n    tabButtons.forEach(button => {\n        button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n            // Remove active classes from all buttons\n            tabButtons.forEach(btn => {\n                btn.classList.remove('border-blue-500', 'text-blue-600');\n                btn.classList.add('border-transparent', 'text-gray-500');\n            });\n            \n            // Add active classes to clicked button\n            this.classList.add('border-blue-500', 'text-blue-600');\n            this.classList.remove('border-transparent', 'text-gray-500');\n            \n            // Hide all tab content\n            tabContents.forEach(content => {\n                content.classList.add('hidden');\n                content.classList.remove('block');\n            });\n            \n            // Show the selected tab content\n            const tabId = this.getAttribute('data-tab');\n            const activeContent = document.getElementById(`tab-${tabId}`);\n            if (activeContent) {\n                activeContent.classList.remove('hidden');\n                activeContent.classList.add('block');\n                \n                // Re-render charts for the active tab if necessary\n                if (tabId === 'dashboard' && typeof initDashboardCharts === 'function') {\n                    setTimeout(initDashboardCharts, 50);\n                } else if (tabId === 'quality' && typeof initQualityCharts === 'function') {\n                    setTimeout(initQualityCharts, 50);\n                } else if (tabId === 'activity' && typeof initActivityCharts === 'function') {\n                    setTimeout(initActivityCharts, 50);\n                } else if (tabId === 'social' && typeof initSocialCharts === 'function') {\n                    setTimeout(initSocialCharts, 50);\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Key Differences to Note\n\n1. Use Tailwind's `hidden` and `block` classes instead of custom CSS\n2. Make sure tab content divs have `id=\"tab-{name}\"` format matching data-tab attributes\n3.

These libraries contain methods that translate directly to C code instead of going through the translation, allowing more power and customizability.\r\n\r\nHowever, as it stands, the implementation of these libraries is located inside `lib/honey/translator.ex` in the `to_c` method. This can be hard to find, customize and improve. Ideally we should move the implementation of these libraries and their methods outside the Translator.ex and into the `lib/honey/c_libraries` so that contribution becomes easier and so that advanced users may customize the implementations of the C counterpart to their own use cases.\r\n\r\nAs an example the implementation of the `Honey.Ethhdr` can be found in `lib/honey/translator.ex` in the format:\r\n```\r\ndef to_c({{:., _, [Honey.Ethhdr, function]}, _, params}, _context) do\r\n  case function do\r\n    :init -> ...\r\n    :const_udp -> ...\r\n    :ip_protocol -> ...\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nand it should be moved to `lib/honey/c_libraries` into a module that defines the functions themselves, such as:\r\n```\r\ndefmodule Honey.Ethhdr do\r\n\r\n  def init() do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def const_udp() do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def ip_protocol() do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nElixir has interesting ways to delegate function calls dynamically during execution, and a solution that leverages that to use the atom passed as a variable into the to_c function as the function name called in the library would be ideal, as it wouldn't require further changes into the `translator.ex` file for each new library.","updatedAt":"2025-03-04T20:22:30Z","user":"Dwctor","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/Dwctor","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45074062?v=4","labels":["refactoring","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":[]},{"title":"Better document imgid and id","url":"https://github.com/openfoodfacts/api-documentation/issues/50","repositoryName":"openfoodfacts/api-documentation","description":"\r\n### What\r\n- Better document the difference between imgid and id\r\n- you can find imgid  in the request, it's a unique id assigned to uploaded images, regardless of whether they are selected or not. \r\n- You apply a rotation to a raw image id, and you place it in id like front_fr (which is a selection)\r\nhttps://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/3017620422003.json?fields=images\r\n\r\nhttps://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3760284870115/tiramisu-patissier\r\nhttps://world.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/376/028/487/0115/1.jpg (1 is imgid)\r\nhttps://world.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/376/028/487/0115/front_fr.8.full.jpg (front_fr is id, the 8 gets assigned automatically)","updatedAt":"2025-03-04T15:01:33Z","user":"teolemon","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/teolemon","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1689815?v=4","labels":["good first issue","image upload"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/ref-v2/#cmp--parameters-imgid"]},{"title":"Brightway Matrix Handling Documentation","url":"https://github.com/brightway-lca/BrightwayHybrid/issues/50","repositoryName":"brightway-lca/BrightwayHybrid","description":null,"updatedAt":"2025-03-03T23:04:00Z","user":"michaelweinold","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/michaelweinold","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23102087?v=4","labels":["documentation","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":[]},{"title":"Missing test: env_vars are generated correctly","url":"https://github.com/riverlane/QStone/issues/50","repositoryName":"riverlane/QStone","description":"We are missing a test to validate that the environment variables are correctly generated from the config_file.\nThe golden image for this test should be used also to initialise the test_apps.py and any test that uses os.environ values.","updatedAt":"2025-03-01T22:15:11Z","user":"mghibaudi","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/mghibaudi","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563515?v=4","labels":["good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":[]},{"title":"feat: update our public templates to use vechain-kit","url":"https://github.com/vechain/vechain-kit/issues/50","repositoryName":"vechain/vechain-kit","description":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vechain-dapp\n\n[x2earn template: ](https://github.com/vechain/x-app-template)\n\nand we should add other templates as well\neg: our examples/next-template should be added to create-vechain-dapp\n\nalso add a react-template (not only next js)\n\nwe could add also the template of mario using parcel: https://github.com/vechain-energy/example-parcel-vechainkit","updatedAt":"2025-02-28T12:53:28Z","user":"Agilulfo1820","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/Agilulfo1820","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6793051?v=4","labels":["good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":[]},{"title":"Truncate strings that are to long","url":"https://github.com/JuliaPerf/PProf.jl/issues/50","repositoryName":"JuliaPerf/PProf.jl","description":"```\r\nError: <stdin>: syntax error in line 22 scanning a quoted string (missing endquote?
