The endpoint should verify availability, create an escrow using Trustless Work, and store the reservation in Supabase, following best practices for data validation, blockchain integration, and error handling.\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0️ Technical Stack\n- **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js\n- **Database**: Supabase\n- **Blockchain**: Stellar (Soroban for availability verification, Trustless Work for escrow)\n- **Authentication**: JWT\n- **Validation**: Zod\n- **Types**: TypeScript\n- **Testing**: Jest\n- **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier\n\n## \uD83D\uDD0D Technical Tasks\n\n### Database Schema\n- [ ] Create `bookings` table in Supabase:\n```sql\ncreate table public.bookings (\n  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,\n  property_id uuid references public.properties(id) not null,\n  user_id uuid references public.users(id) not null,\n  dates jsonb not null, -- { from: \"YYYY-MM-DD\", to: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" }\n  guests integer not null,\n  total decimal(10,2) not null, -- Total cost (nights × price + deposit)\n  deposit decimal(10,2) not null, -- Security deposit\n  escrow_address text not null, -- Stellar address for escrow\n  status text not null default 'pending', -- pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed\n  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,\n  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,\n  constraint status_values check (status in ('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed')),\n  constraint guests_check check (guests > 0),\n  constraint total_check check (total > 0),\n  constraint deposit_check check (deposit >= 0)\n);\n```\n\n### Type definitions\nCreate apps/backend/src/types/booking.types.ts:\n```sql\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n\nexport interface Booking {\n  id: string; // UUID generated by Supabase\n  propertyId: string; // References properties.id\n  userId: string; // References users.id\n  dates: { from: Date; to: Date }; // Reservation dates\n  guests: number; // Number of guests\n  total: number; // Total cost in USDC (nights × price + deposit)\n  deposit: number; // Security deposit in USDC\n  escrowAddress: string; // Stellar escrow address from Trustless Work\n  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled' | 'completed'; // Booking status\n  createdAt: Date; // Automatically managed by Supabase\n  updatedAt: Date; // Automatically managed by Supabase\n}\n\nexport const createBookingSchema = z.object({\n  propertyId: z.string().uuid('Invalid property ID'),\n  userId: z.string().uuid('Invalid user ID'),\n  dates: z.object({\n    from: z.date().refine((date) => date >= new Date(), { message: 'The start date must be in the future' }),\n    to: z.date()\n  }).refine((data) => data.to > data.from, { message: 'The end date must be later than the start date' }),\n  guests: z.number().int('Guests must be an integer').positive('Guests must be positive'),\n  total: z.number().positive('Total cost must be positive'),\n  deposit: z.number().nonnegative('Deposit must be non-negative')\n});\n\nexport type CreateBookingInput = z.infer<typeof createBookingSchema>;\n```\n### Service Layer\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/services/booking.service.ts`:\n  - Implement `createBooking` function to validate availability using Soroban `BookingContract`, create escrow with Trustless Work, and store the reservation in Supabase.\n  - Add error handling for blockchain and database operations.\n  - Add TypeScript types for all operations.\n\n### Controller Layer\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/controllers/booking.controller.ts`:\n  - Implement input validation with Zod.\n  - Handle service responses.\n  - Format error messages.\n  - Add proper status codes (201 for success, 400 for validation errors, etc.).\n\n### Routes\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/routes/booking.routes.ts`:\n  - Set up the booking route for `POST /api/bookings`.\n  - Apply authentication middleware (JWT).\n  - Apply validation middleware (Zod).\n  - Configure error handling.\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Create `apps/backend/src/tests/booking.test.ts`:\n  - Test successful booking creation.\n  - Test authentication failures (missing/invalid token).\n  - Test validation errors (invalid dates, guests, etc.).\n  - Test availability conflicts (using Soroban).\n  - Test escrow creation failures (using Trustless Work).\n  - Test database errors.\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Authentication\n- [ ] Endpoint requires a valid JWT token.\n- [ ] Token must be provided in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` format.\n- [ ] Invalid or missing tokens return 401 with a clear error message.\n\n### Input Validation\n- [ ] All required fields (`propertyId`, `userId`, `dates`, `guests`, `total`, `deposit`) are present and valid.\n- [ ] `propertyId` and `userId` must be valid UUIDs.\n- [ ] `dates.from` must be in the future.\n- [ ] `dates.to` must be later than `dates.from`.\n- [ ] `guests` must be a positive integer.\n- [ ] `total` must be positive.\n- [ ] `deposit` must be non-negative.\n- [ ] Invalid inputs return 400 with validation details.\n\n### Availability Check\n- [ ] Use Soroban `BookingContract` to verify that the requested dates are available for the property.\n- [ ] If dates are unavailable, return 409 with a message: \"Property is not available for the selected dates\".\n\n### Escrow Creation\n- [ ] Use Trustless Work to create an escrow for the payment and deposit.\n- [ ] Store the escrow address in the booking record.\n- [ ] If escrow creation fails, return 500 with a message: \"Failed to create escrow\".\n\n### Response Format\n#### Success (201)\n- A JSON object with a `booking` field containing `bookingId` (e.g., \"book-789\"), `escrowAddress` (e.g., \"GABC...\"), and `status` (e.g., \"pending\").\n\n#### Validation Error (400)\n- A JSON object with an `error` field (\"Validation error\") and a `details` array containing validation errors (e.g., field \"dates.from\" with message \"The start date must be in the future\").\n\n#### Conflict Error (409)\n- A JSON object with an `error` field (\"Property is not available for the selected dates\").\n\n### Error Handling\n- [ ] Authentication errors: 401.\n- [ ] Validation errors: 400.\n- [ ] Availability conflicts: 409.\n- [ ] Escrow or blockchain errors: 500.\n- [ ] Database errors: 500.\n- [ ] All errors include descriptive messages.\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDA References\n- [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs)\n- [Stellar Soroban Documentation](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs)\n- [Trustless Work Documentation](https://trustless.work/docs)\n- [Express.js Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)\n- [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction)\n- [Zod Schema Validation](https://zod.dev/)\n\n## \uD83D\uDD04 Dependencies\n- Authentication middleware implemented.\n- Supabase connection configured.\n- Error handling middleware implemented.\n- Soroban `BookingContract` deployed and accessible.\n- Trustless Work integration configured.\n- Properties and users tables in Supabase.\n\n## \uD83D\uDD12 Security Considerations\n- Validate and sanitize all inputs.\n- Ensure proper CORS configuration.\n- Rate limit the endpoint.\n- Log all booking attempts.\n- Validate total and deposit amounts.\n- Secure blockchain interactions with Trustless Work.\n- Implement retry logic for escrow creation.","updatedAt":"2025-06-04T01:13:57Z","user":"respp","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/respp","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82795026?v=4","labels":["Backend","ODHack 14","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["Hi, my name is Ebubechi, a backend dev skilled in Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Supabase, and Stellar.

This can currently only be done by clicking on the tray icon and selecting the layout that should be active.","updatedAt":"2025-05-29T20:10:38Z","user":"arylix","userHtmlUrl":"https://github.com/arylix","userAvatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173406799?v=4","labels":["help wanted","enhancement","good first issue"],"state":"OPEN","comments":["Hey! Thank you for your suggestion! With this extension my focus is on extending default behavior of GNOME Shell or implement loved features from other OSs. Your idea would be something new, what would be a good default keybinding to select the active layout in your opinion? Of course allowing to customize it from the preferences.","Would SUPER + CTRL + Arrow Left / Arrow Right be a good option?","I suggested this in #36 as well \uD83D\uDE09.\n\nI think it's a great idea to accompany the other keyboard shortcuts which are working great.\n\nI'm not sure what shortcut but something without conflicts would be good. Super + n, super + b?\n\nAway from the computer so not sure if that conflicts.\n\nEdit: if Super + alt is used to span tiles then super + ctrl for this makes sense!","I would also like this feature. \r\n\r\nPerhaps in addition to a keyboard shortcut, would it also be possible to use the scrollwheel while holding a window + CTRL ? So you effectively scroll through the configured layouts.","Thank you guys for your feedback! A quick update for you. I'm going to publish a new update this week and then I'm going to start to work on this :partying_face:\r\n\r\nJust a little mockup for you, feel free to share your thoughts! This feature will behave similarly to ALT+TAB: when the keyboard shortcut is pressed, the layouts are shown and you can cycle through them to select the layout:\r\n![Group 6](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/assets/14203981/44055b6f-64ee-41d6-a7b0-a94512d9c4b0)\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure which default shortcut to choose, but it will be customizable.","This is exactly how I wanted it to be!","Looks good \uD83D\uDE0E","I mentioned in #117 that I'd elaborate on one of my frequent workflows that this would greatly facilitate:\r\n\r\nMy coding layout frequently looks something like this:\r\n```\r\n-------------\r\n|  |   |----|\r\n-------------\r\n```\r\nTwo full-height windows then two half-height windows stacked on top of one another.\r\nThe leftmost window is usually a browser window, the middle my code editor, and the right two are different terminal windows.\r\n\r\nAnother common layout I use (I'm on an ultrawide monitor) is this:\r\n```\r\n-------------\r\n|  |     |  |\r\n-------------\r\n```\r\nThree full-height windows with the center one being larger. I generally have the left two windows the same as above (browser, code editor). Then, the rightmost window is frequently some sort of documentation.\r\n\r\nI frequently switch between these two layouts while working. \r\n","I think this feature would be a great addition as it would eliminate most mouse usage.\r\n\r\nI like the mock-up.\r\n\r\nI suggest `<Super><tab>` as the hot key.  ","I would love this even more now that auto-tiling is a thing! Would complement it nicely imo.","@domferr progress update? it has been ~6 months","Hi @skewty, no progress unfortunately. Believe it or not, but I'm the only developer of Tiling Shell and in the last months I had to make a choice and I had to prioritize other features, I'm sorry. There have been contributions from other developers as well but on other topics.\n\nThis feature is definitely going to be implemented! I believe this is a must have and I hope to prioritize this over other features in the coming releases \uD83C\uDF1F \nMeanwhile, if anyone wants to give it a try, even just contributing to a portion of this feature, the following is a hopefully exhaustive list of things to be done. Feel free to reach me out here or with a new issue if you wanna contribute! Your help would mean A LOT \uD83D\uDC9F \n- Create a widget implementing the mockup above. The sizes could be the same as the ones in ALT+TAB.\n- Listen to a shortcut defined in the settings to show and switch layouts, as in the mockup above. To be more clear, this has to work exactly how ALT+TAB works \uD83D\uDE0E so we can copy the same strategies they use\n- Add a new entry in the preferences' shortcuts to allow users set and unset the shortcut. If the shortcut is set, this feature can be considered enabled, so we don't need to add an enable-disable entry in the preferences too\n- The layout has NOT to be changed globally. The layout has to be changed on the current monitor and current workspace. To switch layout we can follow how I developed the layout switcher behind the indicator icon menu\n- The layout has to be changed when the shortcut is released. For example, if there are 4 layouts, the widget must show which one is the current layout and pressing the shortcut X times would move the selection X times. When moving the selection it is better to don't switch the layout yet, to save resources. The layout can be finally switched when the user has made its decision (e.g. the shortcut is released). To make it more clear, this is exactly the same behaviour we have when pressing ALT+TAB and switching windows\n- Like it works when pressing ALT+TAB, if the user is on the last layout on the right, pressing the shortcut will move the selection to the first layout from the left\n\n_Does it mean that without any contribution this feature will never be implemented?_ No. At some point I will develop it. But any contribution would speed up the process \uD83E\uDD47 ","Hey @domferr has there been any progress on this feature? If not I'd love to find some time to start developing this","Hey @joj0s no progress at all unfortunately! I would love if you could contribute with this feature or just a portion of it!

Copied here as a **mirror**:\r\n\r\nAlready part of https://github.com/diasurgical/scalpel/blob/master/BUGS.md\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details><summary>The DSF Buglist for Diablo v1.09</summary>\r\n\r\nThe intent of this list is not to make Blizzard look bad; in fact, compared to most other computer games out there, Diablo is exceptionally stable and bugless. The intent of this list is to educate and provide insight for anyone wanting to see what parts of the game don't work as intended or are strange. This list was constructed on the Diablo Strategy Forum, from the people who know more about the game than Blizzard itself does. :)\r\n\r\nIf you feel that you know of a reproducible bug that affects gameplay, post about it on the DSF. Find out if it really is a new bug, and I'll get it added.\r\n\r\nHeartfelt thanks and a major thumbs up to all who've contributed bugs or helped explain them so far: Agammaglobulin, Argus McFrugal, Armin, Bolty, Charles Warren, Claudio(Cat), Code Myster, Cyrene, Darkman(BNM), Dark_Slayer, Das Regard, DaveMcW, Dr. Disaster, Dr. Zed, Drasca, El_Gecko, Erthshade, Esau, EviL, felisandria, Flux, Frank, Frenzy, Gorakh, Gyrefalcon, JakRabbit, Jarulf, KingOfPain, Kipo, Lance, Lochnar, M., Mayaheine, mellymel, moe SAINT EverGreen, Mystifier(CB), NoVit4Me, Nystul, Omega, Rand'al, Rich, Ruger, Tahrajj, Thecla, the Sage, Saxywoo, Sourceror, StormDemon, Stu, Tommi Helminen, Uwain, Van Damned, Varaya, and Walkiry.\r\n\r\nUnless stated so, all bugs are multiplayer bugs. Some may apply to single player mode, some may not. Also, a key point here: many of these bugs aren't really bugs, but strange behavior, or quirk, in the game that was probably intentional. The reason they are in this list is because the list is meant to be an educational tool to point out quirks of the game to people who've never heard of them.\r\n\r\nTo date, two immediate game-crashing bugs have been identified in version 1.09.\r\n\r\n# SPELL BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are related to spells and spellcasting.\r\n\r\n## CHARGED BOLT\r\n\r\nIf you stand in a tile of a bookcase or shrine and cast Charged Bolt, the spell effect will be terminated immediately.  No bolts will form, but you will lose mana.\r\n\r\n## FIRE WALL\r\n\r\nFire Walls do more damage than listed in the spell book.\r\n\r\nWhen you walk through a firewall in a way against its alignment, you will not be damaged if you step through its gaps. For instance, walking through a horizontal straight firewall diagonally won't damage you if you walk through at the correct tiles. The same effect applies to monsters and other players.\r\n\r\n## TELEKINESIS\r\n\r\nIf you Telekinesis a monster too much, it's possible for it to disappear into a wall. You will see the graphic in the wall, but no monster.\r\n\r\nYou cannot drink a potion from your belt using number keys while the Telekinesis cursor is active.\r\n\r\nTelekinesis won't work on a monster unless it is activated. These means you can't mess with them if you can only see them with Infravision.\r\n\r\n## TOWN PORTAL\r\n\r\nIf a character goes to pick up an item as he/she is entering a Town Portal, a dupe will appear on the other side, thus creating the same item in town and in the dungeon. Neither item will be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf a character dies while entering a Town Portal he/she will arrive in town dead, being unable to restart in town. The character must be resurrected, or he/she can drink a potion to heal to a living state. Also, if the character was killed by a monster, his/her equipment will fall in town - in a position relative to the level he/she left (sometimes in impossible locations, such as inside buildings).\r\n\r\nCasting a spell just as you enter a Town Portal can cause a casting of the spell in town, producing an Illegal Spell warning.\r\n\r\nOn levels in which \"Gargoyles\" (i.e. Winged Demons, Gargoyles, Blood Claws, and Death Wings) are present, if a player leaves via Town Portal and re-enters the level, upon arrival all Gargoyles' \"stone status\" is not preserved. They'll activate normally, but they'll behave differently had they been in \"stone status.\"\r\n\r\nYou cannot drink a potion from your belt using number keys while the Town Portal cursor is active.\r\n\r\n## FLASH\r\n\r\nIf you stand in the X in the diagram below and cast Flash, monsters in squares 1, 3, and 5 will receive about 1/10 of the normal Flash damage for some weird reason. Conversely, if the MONSTER is in the X, standing in 4, 6, and 8 will limit the damage you will be doing to that monster with flash. This rule also applies for when the monsters are casting Flash.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   1\r\n  2 3\r\n 4 X 5\r\n  6 7\r\n   8\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen casting Flash, your character becomes temporarily invulnerable (but cannot move or take any other action).\r\n\r\n## STONE CURSE\r\n\r\nEnemy mages can be Stone Cursed in mid-teleport, which makes them invisible and invincible until Stone Curse wears off. Golems will even (unsuccessfully) attack mages in this state.\r\n\r\n## FLAME WAVE\r\n\r\nFlame Wave misses every other square when cast in the diagonal, direct left, right, top and bottom screen orientation.\r\n\r\n## FIREBALL\r\n\r\nFireball actually does far more damage than listed in the spell book, as a Fireball hit causes initial damage to the target and then splash damage on top of it.\r\n\r\nSplash damage from Fireballs (possibly other spells) is removed when traveling over objects like spikes, chests, etc. Try casting a Fireball into a pack of Snow Witches behind a spike or something, and only the direct damage will be applied; one witch will be hit, the rest won't be scratched.\r\n\r\n## MANA SHIELD\r\n\r\nAny attack causing more damage than a character's current hit points will not stun the character if they are using Mana Shield. Furthermore, the game considers the character to be in a state of death for a small period of time before his/her hit points are \"refunded\" by the Mana Shield. During this period of death (fraction of a second) the character is actually rendered immune to attacks, and cannot be knocked backward as well.\r\n\r\nPlayers can \"block\" stairways when they enter them. A \"ghost\" image of the character remains at the stair entrance to the other players, and remains until the stair-taking player finishes loading up the next level. This blocking effect occurs 100% of the time when the player has a Mana Shield cast.\r\n\r\nAll spell levels of Mana Shield have the same damage reduction effect, 33%.\r\n\r\nMana Shields only reduce the damage caused by a Constricting Ring by 25%, not 33%.\r\n\r\n## GOLEM\r\n\r\nThe damage listed under the Golem spell in the Spell Book has no meaning. Golems do not do a constant rate of damage; their hit points are controlled by the caster's max mana.\r\n\r\nIf a character steps into a square the Golem was swinging at (to kill a monster) and the Golem hits the character, it then treats the character as an enemy and will attack him.\r\n\r\nIf, while standing adjacent to an enemy, you cast a golem with your cursor on yourself, the golem will appear on your tile. Your golem takes no damage with this bug.\r\n\r\nA Golem has an infinite light radius to anything that uses Succubus, Goat Archer, or Skeleton Archer AI. Any such creature in a line of sight to it will fire at it but will not necessarily be otherwise activated.\r\n\r\nGolems do very minimal damage against witches when the witches are trapped inside a Hell stairwell.\r\n\r\n## SPELL MEMORY CARRYOVER\r\n\r\nUpon starting the Diablo program (before you play any other games of Diablo), start a game; click on the spell speedbook square and press 'S' at the same time. You'll get to use the Null Skill, which does nothing and looks like a fire-based spell.\r\n\r\nIf you use a spell on one character and then switch to a new one who doesn't have that spell, you can use the same technique above to load the old spell on the new character.  If the character doesn't have that spell, it'll show up as a level zero spell.\r\n\r\n## SPELL QUEUING\r\n\r\nYou can queue spells by casting one while another's already being cast, and this can cause lots of problems. Examples are Teleporting only a space or two because the spell queued where your cursor was at the time, casting a spell when you don't have enough mana for it (you get a free cast and end up with negative mana), and firing spells in completely wrong directions because your mouse cursor was moved after the first cast.\r\n\r\nYou can queue a spell before entering a level (while it's still loading), which causes it to take effect to where your cursor was on the level beforehand. So, if the stairs down were on the left side of the upper level, and the entranceway below was on the right side of the lower level, you could cast Teleport and cross the entire lower level instantly. Same goes with other spells such as Town Portal. You can also cause illegal spells in town to occur this way, although the timing is very difficult to get right.\r\n\r\nCertain spells from scrolls can be cast twice if a character casts a read, known spell and interrupts it with the scroll spell, casting twice in rapid succession. This is because the game queues the scroll spell before it realizes it can only be cast once.\r\n\r\nA spell from a staff can be cast even if you run out by queuing the spell before the last spell casts.\r\n\r\n## SCROLL SPELL LEVELS\r\n\r\nScrolls of spells that you cannot read books of (i.e. Infravision) will be cast at the spell level of whatever book-read spell you have selected in your speedbook, when the scroll is cast from the belt. A level 15 Infravision can last a long time.\r\n\r\n## INCORRECT SCROLL DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nScrolls often have the wrong directions for casting.  Scrolls either have a \"Right-click to read\" description or a \"Right-click to read. Left-click to target\" description.  On many spells, the description is wrong.  For instance, the Flash spell scroll has the 'left-click to target' description, even though left clicking is not required.\r\n\r\n## INCORRECT SIGNED/UNSIGNED VALUES\r\n\r\nA bug exists where you can cast spells while you have negative mana.  This can result in incorrect values for spells that depend on mana.  For example, a golem is nearly invincible if it is cast while you have negative mana.  The game treats the negative value as unsigned and thus an enormous HP value is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n# LAG AND DESYNC BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are generally caused by lag and game desyncronization.\r\n\r\n## TOWN PLACEMENT OF \"HOTPOINTS\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally the characters (\"hotpoints\") in town will be in a wildly different location than normal (such as a cow placed right next to Griswold). This is caused by clients arguing over the true position of these hotpoints.\r\n\r\n## TOWN PLACEMENT OF DROPPED ITEMS\r\n\r\nWhen dropping items in town and entering the dungeon, upon return to town the items dropped will have sometimes moved, even to impossible locations - such as inside buildings or across the Tristram borders. This is caused by other players entering the game and not receiving the correct information as to town placement, so the entering client \"moves\" all the items around (as long as no other clients are in town).\r\n\r\n## DISAPPEARING ITEMS\r\n\r\nOccasionally an item will simply disappear when a character tries to pick it up. It is believed to be caused by lag, although there are reports of occurrences in Single Player mode - which may be a wholly different bug. Generally however this is a result of a game desync, when clients do not agree as to the items that were \"generated\" by dying monsters.\r\n\r\n## DESYNCED LEVELS\r\n\r\nWhen playing with a partner, it is possible to play in a disjointed level (possibly related to previous bug). This occurs when the level layouts are different for each player. This causes strange effects such as watching your partner walk through walls. You may also see completely different monsters. It is highly dangerous to play this way, and both players should leave the level immediately.\r\n\r\n## WRONG CHARACTER STATUS\r\n\r\nCharacters can sometimes appear dead, permanently stunned, equipment-less, or other ways due to game desyncs when the player changes his/her status, or when suddenly leaving the game.\r\n\r\n## PLAYER GHOSTS\r\n\r\nIf a player leaves the game while in a \"trouble\" situation (i.e. swarmed by monsters), it may not have a graceful exit. The character's \"ghost\" remains, the picture of the player. It can be highlighted by another player, even attacked. On other players' screens that can see the ghost, they may see monsters try to attack the ghost.\r\n\r\n## EXITING PLAYERS\r\n\r\nWhen a player is lagged out, or \"times out\" of a game, the other clients will occasionally see a \"Player has left the game\" message instead of the time out message.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n# EQUIPMENT BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are related to effects caused by equipment or equipment generation.\r\n\r\n## STEALTH EFFECTS\r\n\r\nWhen using items that reduce a character's light radius, a character will only activate monsters who are in that light radius. However, the character's light radius for attracting monsters depends upon the highest light radius the character had on a level until he/she exits the level. If the light radius is increased/decreased while on the level, it will alter the player's light radius, but not in terms of monster attraction - they will be attracted to the highest radius that existed at any time on the character. In other words, always have stealth equipment equipped BEFORE entering a level, and if you drop a stealth item, you'll have to leave the level and come back to use its effect on monster attraction again.\r\n\r\nWhen at full stealth level (-80% light radius), walls sometimes cannot be mapped even when the character is right next to them. Also, portions of the map for a level will appear as revealed very far away from the character's position. And, last of all, you won't see a monster one square away from you if it's at a diagonal angle. It won't see you, either.\r\n\r\n## HIGH DURABILITY WRAPAROUND\r\n\r\nWhen a character is saved with an item that has over 255 durability, its durability wraps around back to 1 to 10 durability. This can cause strange effects when using Hidden Shrines or finding items with durability-boosting suffixes that would normally cause its durability to be higher than 255.\r\n\r\nIf you use Hidden Shrines to take an item to exactly 255 durability, the item will transform to an indestructible item. This is because Blizzard used 255 in their code that checks whether an item is indestructible.\r\n\r\nItems raised to 256 durability with Hidden Shrines have a number of problems.  When starting a new game, the item will have zero maximum durability.  Any attempt to repair the item at Griswold will then crash the game.  Any attempt to repair the item with a warrior's Repair Skill (when it is something other than 0/0 durability) will result in the either the immediate disappearance of the item, or the item will become unselectable and will disappear when clicked on again.\r\n\r\n## GRISWOLD'S REPAIRS\r\n\r\nOccasionally Griswold will charge you for repairing an item and yet not repair it, forcing you to have to pay for repairs again, and possibly multiple times.\r\n\r\nGriswold will not repair a cursed item because its value to him is negative or less than one.\r\n\r\nGriswold can only repair an item when at least 1% of its durability has been lost; therefore, items over 100 durability can only be repaired after they've lost more than one durability point (over 200, 2 points).\r\n\r\n## ADRIA'S ISSUES\r\n\r\nOccasionally Adria will charge you for recharging a staff and yet not recharge it, forcing you to have to pay for recharge again, and possibly multiple times.\r\n\r\nAdria will recharge a staff for free if the number of charges to be reset is less than 1% of the total number of charges on the staff.\r\n\r\nIf you sell an item at Adria and you don't have enough room for the cash to be placed in your inventory, the excess gold is lost.\r\n\r\n## DEADLY HUNTER\r\n\r\nThis unique bow is listed as doing +200% damage versus demons, just as the BloodSlayer (axe) and Civerb's Cudgel (mace). However, while the Civerb's Cudgel and Bloodslayer have the effect of tripling a characters total damage to demons (not the weapon damage, but the total), the Deadly Hunter does not. This is caused by the way the game engine handles arrows differently than melee weapons.\r\n\r\n## IMPOSSIBLE ITEMS\r\n\r\nDue to the item generation rules of Diablo, these unique items cannot be found: Bramble, Crackrust, Lightforge, The Deflector, Gonnagal's Dirk, and The Mangler.\r\n\r\n## KING'S VS. CHAMPION'S PREFIX\r\n\r\nThe prefix \"Champion's,\" while being weaker than \"King's,\" is considered more valuable in terms of rarity in the game. This causes \"Champion's\" to be unfindable from any monster; it can only be bought from Wirt. This is a result of a hasty change in the value of the \"King's\" prefix before the release of the game - it was lowered to make it easier to obtain, and \"Champion's\" was not.\r\n\r\n## SWING SPEED\r\n\r\nThe suffix \"of Haste\" is supposed to be faster than \"of Speed,\" but they both produce the same swing speed as they eliminate the same number of animation frames on an attack. Blizzard incorrectly claims this was fixed in the 1.07 patch.\r\n\r\nThe suffix \"of readiness\" (designed to drop one frame of animation) is useless.\r\n\r\n## DEATH WITH CURSED ITEMS\r\n\r\nWhen dying from monsters' attacks, a character loses all items. If he/she was carrying items that lower hitpoints, he/she will regain the hitpoints that were drained by those (either cursed items or certain uniques). Upon dropping the items, the player will sometimes reach a value of hit points greater than zero - but the character will remain dead on his/her screen. For other players in the game this character has positive hitpoints, though, and thus they will not see a corpse and thus be unable to cast resurrect on him/her.\r\n\r\n## SHARP PREFIX\r\n\r\nThe prefix \"Sharp\" is considered a cursed prefix by the game (it shouldn't be), so you can't buy it in town.\r\n\r\n## CURSED AC ROUNDING\r\n\r\nWhen a cursed prefix or suffix modifies the AC value of an item, it is supposed to lower the AC. However, if the amount of AC to be lowered rounds down to zero, the AC is actually raised by 1. For example, an AC 3 helm with -26% AC will yield an AC of 4, since 26% of 3 is rounded to 1.\r\n\r\n## \"RED\" ITEMS\r\n\r\n\"Red\" items (i.e. items that you are \"wearing\" but cannot use because you don't meet the requirements), put on your character by using an item that gave you the requirements, equipping it, and then removing the item that allowed you to use it, will lose durability just like items you're allowed to use.\r\n\r\nEven though a red item cannot be used by your character, it will still modify your damage based on weapon type.  If you use a \"red\" sword, for instance, your fist damage will be raised by 1.5 times when you punch animals, and lowered by 0.5 times when you punch undead.\r\n\r\n## GRISWOLD/WIRT PRICING INCONSISTENCY\r\n\r\nIf you buy an item from Wirt and then go to sell it to Griswold, he will offer you one fourth of the price you paid Wirt for it.  If you then start a new game, however, Griswold will only offer you one fourth of what HE would sell it for (less money).\r\n\r\n## CORRUPTION SUFFIX\r\n\r\nEquipping an item \"of Corruption\" when you have negative mana will actually GIVE you mana, setting your mana to zero.\r\n\r\nIf you equip an item of corruption and afterwards equip mana adding items, mana will still be added.  Also, when you take off the corruption item and re-equip it, mana will not be reset to 0, but instead to what it previously was (i.e., mana from items equipped after equipping the corruption item will still be added).\r\n\r\nMore seriously, if your character has negative max mana (possible with mana-reducing items such as the Cranium Basher), using an item of Corruption will set your mana to zero.  Removing it keeps your current mana at zero (of a max of a negative number).  If you then unequip the item(s) which gave you negative max mana, the game will immediately crash.  Don't try this at home.\r\n\r\n## GOLD IMAGE STABILITY\r\n\r\nImages of gold piles are updated incorrectly sometimes.  For instance, if you have two piles of gold totaling between 5,000 and 10,000 gold, you can merge one gold pile with the other and the amounts will switch.  If this causes one pile to obtain a \"smaller\" shape, drop it on the ground and pick it back up - it will have the older image of a larger pile again.\r\n\r\n## UNFINDABLE ITEMS IN DUNGEONS\r\n\r\nMonsters in each level of difficulty have the same value for item drops in terms of prefixes and suffixes; therefore, many high-end prefixes and suffixes can never be dropped by a monster. Specifically, these prefixes and suffixes cannot be found on items dropped by monsters: Mammoth, Whale, Holy, Godly, Weird, Strange, Champion's, Ruthless, Merciless, Carnage, Slaughter, Osmosis, Burning, and Thunder.  Only Wirt can sell you these prefixes and suffixes.  Hydra's and Wyrm's enchantments cannot be generated in town or in dungeon.\r\n\r\n## FIRE/LIGHTNING SUFFIX ISSUES\r\n\r\nDamage from Fire or Lightning elemental arrows will occasionally be highly excessive. It is caused by the calculation for the damage occurring multiple times as it hits its target. This occurs on traps sometimes, as well.\r\n\r\nWhen a monster is hit by a fire damage arrow, it stops regenerating hit points.  This even applies to the Dark Lord, Diablo.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n# DUNGEON LAYOUT/POSITIONAL BUGS\r\n\r\nAll bugs in this category are related to problems with dungeon layouts, level transitions, the positions of objects, and other errors caused by the tile layout design of the game.\r\n\r\n## SCREEN DRAW ERRORS IN CAVES\r\n\r\nCertain wall formations in the caves can cause screen draw problems which are harmless. This is caused by spots on the level map that do not contain graphics, usually seen as stalagmites. Images in them will \"ripple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mirroring\" effects can be seen where a character's image will appear in lava pools.\r\n\r\n## LEVEL RESETS\r\n\r\nOccasionally, if you go down a set of stairs, back up, and back down again, the entire level changes. This includes wall placements, creatures, etc...which can lead to you arriving in the middle of a pack of monsters, or a wall.\r\n\r\n## HELL'S INVISIBLE WALLS\r\n\r\nSometimes in Hell levels, especially level 16, hidden walls exist which cannot be seen by the player but are treated as physical barriers that also block sight and shots. There seems to be a correlation between dead body parts hung on walls (aka \"Shish Kebabs\") and hidden wall squares.\r\n\r\n## HOLES IN THE WALL\r\n\r\nMany walls in the game have holes in them that allow arrows and spells to leak through. One such hole exists on the left side of Lazarus' chamber.\r\n\r\n## IMPOSSIBLE LEVELS\r\n\r\nVery rarely will a level be generated that is not continuous - it is split into sides that can only be accessed by casting Phasing or Teleport.\r\n\r\n## FAR OFF MAP SQUARES\r\n\r\nOccasionally dotted map squares, corresponding to walls and inaccessible areas, will be visible on the map upon level entry - even when being very far away.\r\n\r\n## MONSTERS IN WALLS\r\n\r\nMonsters will occasionally appear inside closed doors or walls, as they are generated there. As soon as they enter your light radius they simply walk out of the wall/door they were \"in.\"\r\n\r\n## RANGED ATTACK ANGLES\r\n\r\nCertain angles of ranged attack against monsters will result in a character being unable to hit them; the character will have to move a square to be able to score a hit. Shots fired in straight lines to the target are much easier to connect.\r\n\r\n## SHARING SQUARES\r\n\r\nWhen a character teleports/phases onto a square that a monster was moving in to, they will overlap. The character will have to move off the square to hit the monster. The monster, however, can attack the same square it's standing on.\r\n\r\nIf two characters wind up occupying the same square, which can happen rarely when casting Teleport or when Resurrecting while standing over a body, the player who does not move will become invisible to both players, until he/she moves. Further, the player first on the internal list of players may be the first targeted and attacked if a monster approaches.\r\n\r\nThe player can also share a square with a Golem.\r\n\r\n## STAIRWAY PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nA character can teleport/phase into a stairway leading down in Hell levels and \"levitate\" in the open area inside the \"cage\" of the stairway. He/she can then shoot ranged attacks out of the mouth of the stairway, but no ranged attacks from monsters can get in from certain angles.\r\n\r\nIf you enter the caves via the cave mouth entrance near Wirt, you can run the mouse cursor over the stairs on level 9, and a small spot on the right side of the stairs will read \"up to level 8.\" If you left click on that spot your character will begin walking towards the level 8 stairs (even if you can't see them on the map), unless the way is blocked by lava, grates, or some other obstacle. If you teleport onto that spot, your character will teleport all the way to the level 8 stairs and go up!\r\n\r\nPlayers can \"block\" stairways when they enter them. A \"ghost\" image of the character remains at the stair entrance to the other players, and remains until the stair-taking player finishes loading up the next level. This blocking effect occurs 100% of the time when the player has a Mana Shield cast.\r\n\r\nMonsters that use Hidden AI are always active.  Unless there's a barrier between them and the player (e.g. closed door, barrels completely blocking a path), they'll reach the player without any action on the player's part.\r\n\r\nThe game normally doesn't generate monsters within a certain range of the stairs.  This does not apply to rooms, however.  For example, you may enter a level of the caves and find Storm Demons waiting 7 squares away, placed there because they are inside a fenced area. They will fire at you immediately, open the door, and come after you.\r\n\r\n## BOSS LIGHT RADII\r\n\r\nAll bosses in Diablo emit a light radius visible to players. If they move, their light radius moves as well. However, if you leave the level and re-enter, the bosses original positions will have a light radius on the floor, even when the boss' dead body is located at a different position on the level.\r\n\r\n## LEVEL ENTRANCE DISPLACEMENT\r\n\r\nWhen players use stairwells to go down, each player will see the other in the wrong spot at next level, with their player being in the \"correct\" position and the partner displaced. When the characters move, the game engine corrects this situation by showing the other player walk one space over.\r\n\r\nIn a similar fashion, a player taking another player's Town Portal down to a level can wind up on the other side of a wall if the portal was placed just to the \"north\" of the wall. This is due to a displacement of one square, as the player cannot land on the exact square of the Portal (they'd head right back up again, then).\r\n\r\n## TRAP RESETTING\r\n\r\nIf a door with a trap is opened, thus setting off the trap, and the door is closed again, you can \"reset\" the trap. Leave the level and come back to it, and the trap will be reset.\r\n\r\n## 127 LIMIT\r\n\r\nYou cannot drop more than 127 items on the floor in any one level, including town. Note that this can cause you to lose monster drops if you have 127 items on the floor of a level, since a dying monster will have no \"room\" to drop it and it will simply never exist. Remember that every pile of gold is an \"item.\"\r\n\r\nDiablo also has a 127 limit as to the number of ongoing spell effects (including arrows) that can appear on a level at any one time, which is 127. Some spells, especially Chain Lightning, can use up several effects.\r\n\r\n## ITEM DROPS ON SHRINE/BOOKCASE TILES\r\n\r\nIf an item drops on the tile for a shrine or bookcase, you cannot highlight or pick up the item until activating the shrine or bookcase.\r\n\r\n## MOONBENDER'S LIGHT RADIUS\r\n\r\nThe light square of Moonbender (a Blink boss) will freeze in place if it 'blinks' next to you, and won't follow the boss even if the boss moves afterward.\r\n\r\n## UNHITTABLE WHEN WALKING HORIZONTALLY\r\n\r\nWhen a character (or monster) walks horizontally on the screen (as in on your monitor), he/she/it cannot be hit by most spells and ALL arrows, even when fired on the same line of action of the walker.\r\n\r\n## GOING UP AND DOWN STAIRS\r\n\r\nYou will only descend a stairwell while you're in \"walk\" mode.  Other actions, such as swinging or casting, will prevent you from descending a staircase.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n# MISCELLANEOUS BUGS\r\n\r\nEverything else.\r\n\r\n## DUPLICATES\r\n\r\nVarious duplication bugs/quirks exist in Diablo.\r\n\r\nVendors can occasionally sell duplicates.  Duplicates of potions are somewhat common since the range of ID numbers assigned to potions is rather small\r\n\r\nYou'll occasionally find the exact same item twice (or even thrice) in the same dungeon.  After ID'ing, these items will produce a duplicate item message when simultaneously dropped.\r\n\r\nThe commonly abused duplication has to do with the item-pickup routine. Blizzard has never fixed the item-pickup bug.  They claim that it cannot be fixed without an overhaul of the game engine, but this seems incorrect as it has been fixed in modifications.\r\n\r\n## FIFTH SPELL BOOK PAGE\r\n\r\nClicking on the small area between the number 4 and the right edge of the spellbook causes a blank page to appear.\r\n\r\n## PRICE LIMIT\r\n\r\nThe upper limit to the price of items Griswold or Adria can sell you is 140,000 gold, even though a character could still buy an item that takes up six slots and carry 170,000 gold. Wirt's limit is 135,000 gold.\r\n\r\n## FAMILIARS\r\n\r\nFamiliars are demons and not animals like all of the other bat types.\r\n\r\n## BOSS AND MONSTER APPEARANCE\r\n\r\nDue to the dungeon level assignments of bosses and their corresponding monster types in the code, certain bosses can never appear in the game. For example, Lord of the Pit (Azure Drake boss) is assigned to appear on dlvl 13 whereas Azure drakes cannot appear on 13; thus, no boss.\r\n\r\nSome bosses are assigned monster types which don't appear in-game. Monsters that don't appear: Invisible Lord, Lord Sayter, Wyrm, Cave Slug, Devil Wyrm, Devourer, Bone Demon, Red Death, Litch Demon, Undead Balrog, Incinerator, Flame Lord, Doom Fire, Hell Burner, Devil Kin Brute, Unraveler, Hollow One, Pain Master, Reality Weaver, The Arch-Litch Malignus. (Satyr Lords, Devil Kin Brutes, Bone Demons, and Unravelers do make an appearance in Hellfire, however.)  Bosses not appearing in the game:\r\n\r\n## *Name* - Type: Dungeon level\r\n\r\n- *Blightstone the Weak* - Lord Sayter: 4\r\n- *Hazeshifter* - Unseen: 5\r\n- *Warmaggot the Mad* - Wyrm: 6\r\n- *Glasskull the Jagged* - Red Storm\t: 7\r\n- *Wrathfire the Doomed* - Incinerator: 8\r\n- *Bronzefist Firestone* - Hellstone: 8\r\n- *Doomgrin the Rotting* - Red Death: 8\r\n- *Stormbane* - Storm Rider: 9\r\n- *Madburner* - Flame Lord: 9\r\n- *Lord of the Pit* - Azure Drake: 13\r\n- *Bonesaw the Litch* - Litch Demon: 9\r\n- *Grimspike* - Obsidian Lord: 19\r\n- *Devilskull Sharpbone* - Red Death: 9\r\n- *Doomlock* - Storm Lord - 28\r\n- *Warpfire Hellspawn* - Hell Burner: 11\r\n- *Blacktongue* - Counselor: 12\r\n- *Festerskull* - Undead Balrog: 11\r\n- *Soulslash* - Unraveler: 12\r\n- *Howlingire the Shade* - Hollow One: 13\r\n- *Bloodmoon Soulfire* - Pain Master: 13\r\n- *Zamphir* - Reality Weaver: 15\r\n\r\n## SHRINES\r\n\r\nAn Enchanted Shrine will reduce a spell by two levels if it is base level 15, instead of just one spell level reduction. This is caused by how the shrine works - it raises all spell levels by one and then picks a spell to reduce by 2 levels. A level 15 spell will not raise to 16 and then go down to 14, it will stay 15 and be reduced to 13.\r\n\r\nMysterious Shrines, Tainted Shrines, and Fountains of Tears do the same kind of thing with character stats - they can pick a stat to be raised that's already maxed, and wind up lowering all the other stats.\r\n\r\nDue to a design flaw in how the game engine handles the random effects in shrines, Hidden Shrines will tend to reduce the durability of the item in the right slot (left hand) more often. Mysterious Shrines will tend to raise Dexterity more often than other stats. Enchanted shrines will tend to reduce Chain Lightning more often than the other spells. This effect becomes less noticeable the more you play in a single gaming session, i.e. the shrine effects will become more 'random.' Namely, the \"random seed\" stored with ANY shrine is not initialized properly, and the shrine uses whatever happens to be in that memory location. At startup this memory will mostly be \"empty\", which is read as zero, which then causes the non-random behavior. After the game is played for a while, the memory is much less likely to be zero, and therefore tends to approach randomness.\r\n\r\n## ZERO HIT POINT ISSUES\r\n\r\nUnder special circumstances a character can wind up with 0 hit points and yet not die. The character then is invincible to all forms of attack unless he/she heals or has Heal Other cast upon the character. This is apparently caused by some portions of the code treating -1 HP as death, not 0.\r\n\r\nA character with negative hit points will be killed by any sort of Healing.\r\n\r\n## RESURRECT IN TOWN\r\n\r\nOccasionally when a character is resurrected by another player in the dungeons, players in town can see the beam of light in town corresponding to the player's position on a level in the dungeon.\r\n\r\n## DUPE MESSAGE ON GAME ENTRY\r\n\r\nIf a player enters a game at the exact same time that another player drops an item in town, the entering player will see a \"A duplicate item has been detected from another player\" message.\r\n\r\n## PLAYER FRIENDLY MODE IN DUELS\r\n\r\nIf you use a melee weapon against a character who has set themselves on \"Player Friendly\" you cannot stun lock him/her. This does not apply to attacks with a a bow.\r\n\r\n## KNOCKBACK PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nWhen being hit by a creature with knockback power (or a character with a knockback weapon) such as Diablo or a charging beast, you can be knocked back physically, but your light radius does not move unless your character makes some form of move (either walking or attacking). Thus, you can eventually be knocked outside of your own light radius and all creatures will disappear.\r\n\r\nKnockback bows do not knock enemies back 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nHitting a monster/player will knock them back according to the direction they are facing; thus, you can technically knock a creature back towards you if it's facing away from you.\r\n\r\n## SINGLE PLAYER DIFFICULTY LEVELS\r\n\r\nIf you start a multiplayer game at Nightmare or Hell difficulty and then quit to start a single player game, the single player game will be the same difficulty as the multiplayer one, including the value of experience per monster, gold drops, etc.\r\n\r\n## BOSS ERRORS\r\n\r\nPowerful bosses in higher levels of difficulty have their experience level overflow, as the game calculates the experience level for them too many times.\r\n\r\nBosses in Nightmare and Hell difficulties are sometimes far weaker than they should be, with poor AC and to-hit%. This is because these values are byte values and they overflow with higher difficulty bonuses.\r\n\r\nDiablo in Nightmare and Hell difficulties suffers from the same problem as the bosses above.\r\n\r\n## LEVEL 50 CROSSOVER PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nAny partners in a game where a player levels up to 50 will still see the player as level 49 in that game.\r\n\r\nA character does not receive a hit point or mana point bonus on leveling to 50.\r\n\r\n## SINGLE PLAYER LEVEL BONUSES\r\n\r\nPlayers get an extra 1/64th HP and MP on leveling up in single player in addition to a full 64/64.\r\n\r\n## GOLD LOSS ON DEATH\r\n\r\nIf you are carrying a large amount of gold in your inventory, you stand to lose much more than half of it when you die. The game won't drop enough piles of it and the piles themselves will have less than 5,000 gold each. It apparently doesn't generate the gold correctly when you are defeated.\r\n\r\n## EARS\r\n\r\nEars from the same character are duplicates.\r\n\r\nIf a player dies from a PK attack and an ear from that character is already on the floor somewhere, a new ear will not be generated (related to bug above).\r\n\r\n## YEAR 2039 RANDOMIZER ISSUE\r\n\r\nThe game engine will stop creating random levels after midnight of January 1, 2039. Any game started before January 1, 1970, will also not be random.\r\n\r\n## CHARACTER DAMAGE UPDATE UPON LEVEL UP\r\n\r\nWhen a character levels up, the damage displayed in the character screen may be incorrect until the status of the character changes. Status changes include the removal and/or applying of equipment or a raise in character attributes.\r\n\r\n## TRAP DAMAGE\r\n\r\nTrap damage does not get increased by difficulty.  Traps in Nightmare and Hell difficulties do the same amount of damage as the ones in Normal.  This makes traps for high-level characters meaningless.\r\n\r\n## ATTRIBUTE WRAPAROUND\r\n\r\nIf an attribute of a character becomes negative, which can be accomplished through the use of Mysterious and Tainted Shrines (by partners touching them), on starting a new game the character's attribute will wrap around to 255-value.  If magic or vitality wrap around this way, the character will NOT gain the hit points and mana one would expect from this \"gain.\"  For example, if a warrior obtains -2 magic, in the next game he starts he'll have 253 magic (which will then be limited to 50 magic, his max).  However, a character will not gain mana from this wrap around, thus harshly corrupting the character.\r\n\r\n## BLOCK BONUS LOSS\r\n\r\nCharacters in Diablo are supposed to have a blocking bonus;  30 for a warrior, 20 for a rogue, and 10 for a sorcerer.  This would be equivalent to a warrior having 30 more dexterity in terms of blocking ability, and likewise for the other two classes.  However, this bonus is not saved with the character when it is saved (via Save Game in Single Player or Exit Game in Multiplayer).  Thus, a character has a blocking bonus when it is started which is lost forever after the first session - a huge loss for ironman characters.\r\n\r\n## TOWN TALKING\r\n\r\nIf you press F1 to open the help screen and then talk to a townsperson, pressing F1 to clear the help screen overlay causes the talk menu to stretch out across the screen.  When this happens, you cannot select any of the talk menu's options and must clear it using the Esc key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n# GAMEPLAY BUGS FIXED IN PREVIOUS OR CURRENT VERSIONS OF DIABLO\r\n\r\n## VERSION 1.08\r\n\r\n- *Mac Only* Improved Mac vs. PC multiplayer, modem, and direct connect.\r\n\r\n## VERSION 1.07\r\n\r\n- Fixed crashes associated with being attacked or killed by a Black Death (Zombie class).

When a fix is found and added via comment to the code the issue could be closed. this way there would be a better overview of the known bugs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could also implement the fixes not as comments but in an IF DEFINED statement instead so that a bugfree version could be compiled with a special flag.","I love the first idea, but `IF DEFINED statement` is an issue. For one, some bugs are graphical and require patching game assets. Two, those that are code related, many are certainly not just a clean one-liner and some are tied to multiple functions. Some may be relevant to another bugfix or require rewriting a function here, fixing this there etc. In the end you'd end up with something that looks almost as ugly as what IDA spat out.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to point no. 2. This probably wasn't mentioned before so here it is: my long term goal was to get the code cleaned up and produce 100% exact results (which we did). Afterwards, using the code as a ***reference*** from which everything can be rewritten from the ground up. This would allow fixing bugs, modern coding practices, more efficient and easier to mod etc. while guaranteed accurate unlike the many re-implementation projects floating around that were based off guesswork.\r\n(It's not open source, but I've done this with Diablo's UI using the original as a guide)\r\n\r\nSo imo Devilution should die where it is. Some asswipe released the official code (hey buddy that's great but ya' could have done so sooner ok??). Which effectively achieves the above goal several times over in that now we have the purest reference from which to work, but also rendered many manual-hours by me (and a few others) nigh-useless. So there is our starting point, don't use it, don't copy it, but reference it. The even tastier fruit is for all hands taking.\r\n\r\nWhat the new owner(s) of Devilution do is up to them: _Buy it break it fix it smash it melt it love it hate it burn it_. If coming up with a multiple if-def nested monster is what they choose or not. Just my 2 cents, the last 2 cents I had saved up for college.","The idea is definitely nice, but I agree that a lot of ifdef is going to turn ugly real quick. Instead, we are fixing them in DevilutionX 1.x.y. We have also unified the shareware and retail version and made it detected what version to run depending on the provided MPQ and intend to do the same with hellfire exactly to minimize the amount of ifdef found in the code.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick example of what issues you quickly encounter with a lot of `ifdef` in the code:\r\n```cpp\r\n#ifdef FIX\r\nif (bug && fix) {\r\n#else\r\nif (bug) {\r\n#endif\r\n    // Am I indented once or twice?\r\n}\r\n// is this file broken?\r\n```","Forgot to mention that as well but yeah we have a lot of those from debug related ifdef code. At least on Windows I use Notepad++ which has the ability to fold nested code, and it causes lots of issues since it doesn't know where to stop.","You've convinced me.

In that case, no OFILE_CANDLE2 assets are loaded.\r\n\r\nIf the assets are not loaded, then a second bug happens, where while searching for the assets the game will simply run off past the end of an array into no-man's-land until it randomly finds a byte that matches what it is looking for.

There are two unique items in the game which can spawn on two base items. \"Gnarled Root\" (Club/Spiked Club) and \"Stormshield\" (Tower/Gothic Shield). This is definitely a bug as items in the global item table are supposed to have a unique ID per item, so unique items can reference that ID. However, Club/Spiked Club use the same ID instead of the latter being none. Same applies to tower shield.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Warrior's Club has the same entry for unique item lookup as Club. It should be empty however. Lightforge also uses the wrong lookup type in the unique item table, using a regular mace, allowing it to drop. It always morphs on a new game because of this. It is a quest item and special drop.","Empty mana orb doesn't match background:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/204594/133828679-bab3c69c-9041-4a44-a928-3af74606e9fc.png)\r\n(there are bits of gold in the wing from a previous UI element at that position)","The way diablo chooses levels for magic affixes is buggy and leads to several problems. So I'll explain. First they are chosen in one of three ways depending on item type:\r\n- **All items but staves**: min level is 1/2 base level and capped to 25\r\n- Staves **with** charges: no minimum affix level\r\n- Staves **without** charges: min level is 1/2 base level and *not* capped\r\n\r\nBug # 1: Staves are like jewelry in that they are *always* supposed to be magic or contain charges. It is possible however to find a plain white staff. For example, a level 4 monster drops a magic staff with a suffix, however there are no suffixes between the level range (2-4) thus it drops without anything.\r\n\r\nBug # 2: Minimum magic level is capped to 25 max. Now only Wirt is capable of generating items this high. Why is this a problem? It means past a certain point some affixes stop spawning. At character level 50, Wirt can no longer sell Obsidian (thus the famous Ob Zods).\r\n\r\nWhen fixing monsters to drop with their difficulty bonus, it opens up a plethora of affix bugs.\r\n- Level 50+ monsters can't drop staves with a suffix\r\n- Various other items have few/no affixes once monsters reach a high enough level\r\n\r\nWhen removing the level cap, it additionally opens up these bugs:\r\n- Rings/amulets dropped by level 56+ monsters can only spawn with one affix, Zodiac. No prefixes spawn\r\n- Certain unique monsters such as Lazarus, on **_hell difficulty_**, will only drop white rings/amulets (no affixes at all)\r\n\r\nThis may just be an odd design quirk, but once you fix monsters, the minimum level set on affixes really starts breaking the game.\r\n","Diablo's magical unique loot system explained using staff of shadows as an example:\r\nStaff of shadows uses long staff (lvl 4) as a base and is lvl 2 itself.\r\nIf multiple unique items meet the requirements, the one lowest on the list gets chosen.\r\nImmolator is lvl 4 and uses a long staff base too.\r\n\r\nWhich means in theory staff of shadows can never drop, because if lvl 4+ loot drops (to roll the long staff), then immolator will always gets picked over staff of shadows. Ofc you can get it to drop in single player if immolator drops first, because then it will stop blocking staff of shadows - such a staff will morph back into immolator in vanilla's new game.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's possible to get a stable one because of a bug described in https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/pull/2763\r\nItem generation is messed up because monster level increased by difficulty bonus/unique monster bonus is only used for generating the base item - affix/unique item generation uses monster's starting level (ignoring boss/difficulty modifiers)\r\nWhich means there's one scenario where staff of shadows can drop - lvl 2 or 3 monster on nightmare/hell difficulty.\r\nLet's take a lvl 2 monster as an example.\r\nDifficulty bonus = 15 on nightmare and 30 on hell.\r\nBase item would roll with (2 + difficulty bonus) level, which means a long staff can drop.\r\nBut affix/unique item would get rolled with the original level = 2 = congrats, it's a staff of shadows!\r\n\r\nTo make it even more confusing, unique monsters have a hardcoded +4 bonus to affix/unique generation level BUT NOT the base item level - which means that you can only get staff of shadows from a NON-UNIQUE lvl 2-3 monster on nightmare/hell difficulty, because if it was a unique monster, the long staff could always hit immolator.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a bug because there's 0 reason why for example celestial bow (which looks like something a lvl 3 rogue would be happy about but later? ...) can only drop on nightmare or hell ;)\r\n\r\nTo make it even more funny, it means that in singleplayer you can get some uniques in 2 versions - stable or unstable that will morph in a new game.\r\nAn unstable staff of shadows would drop if it only dropped because you already got immolator before it and a stable one would drop from a scenario described above.\r\nHope that's not very confusing, only took 25 years to find out \uD83E\uDD2A \r\n","Adjacent attack damage from Monk, Bard, and Barbarian attacks with certain weapon types is handled by calling the damage function again but passing the negative `pnum` value for that player. The negative value signals to the function that the chance to hit and damage penalties for adjacent damage should apply to the attack. However, player 1 has a `pnum` value of `0` so instead of a negative number, it just passes `0` and calculates damage as normal. This means the chance to hit and damage penalties do not apply to player 1, but they do apply to other players.","Runes of Lightning never deal damage. When a monster steps on the rune, a Lightball missile is generated on the tile, but damage is never set for the missile, so min and max damage are both 0.

This means that you can have a player receive less than full XP while another player receives full XP. This happens when a player has hit a monster, another player loads onto the level and kills the hit monster before anyone else hits the monster again. The player that loaded onto the floor only sees themselves hit the monster, so they get full XP, while the original player (or players) get split XP.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/issues/3110\r\n\r\nI also noticed that monster tags get cleared (mWhoHit) if all players leave a floor. I'd say it's debatable if this is a bug or not, but feels like it is (and feels connected to the above issue).\r\n\r\nEditing to add: https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/issues/3111\r\n\r\nI did not test to confirm, but it is very likely this issue with mWhoHit is also Vanilla behavior. It's possible for mWhoHit to just desync altogether even if all players were on the floor during a fight with a monster. As described in the linked issue, the player that attempted the attack missed, but the other player saw the hit land, so mWhoHit desynced. If the player that saw a hit now kills the monster, they get half XP while the other player gets 0 XP. Monster health did not desync at all, so mWhoHit does not use the same mechanisms that damage to monsters use.","Monster hp is not synced when a player enters the level.\r\nPlayer 1 damages a monster\r\nPlayer 2 enters level and sees the monster with full hp.","Monsters will inform the group lader that they spotted the player, but the leader will not inform the rest of the pack.

Here is a graph showing the intermediate price of an item during this calculation, right after applying the multiplier to an item with a base value of 1000.\r\n\r\n![intermediate-price](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9203145/164746603-1043f063-db1b-424e-a7e1-4f3dc0da8cc3.png)\r\n\r\nSo long as the multiplier is positive, everything seems okay. But when the graph slips into negative multipliers, it seems that the more extreme negative values produce a more valuable item than the less extreme ones. Normally, this doesn't matter because cursed affixes nearly always define their adder as 0 so the multiplier alone will nearly always drive the final value of the computation into the negatives, which then gets coerced into an item value of 1 gold piece. However, this breaks down a bit with the Hyena's prefix which has a positive adder, so applying a cursed suffix to drive the multiplier down can actually increase the final price of the item.\r\n\r\nBased on the math used in the equation, it seems to me that the equation was meant to use the absolute value of the multiplier such that cursed affixes would merely reduce the effect of the base value on the final price of the item. Here's how the same graph would look with the absolute value correction.\r\n\r\n![corrected-price](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9203145/164748696-6f4e146b-7645-4c96-a517-31fd154ea0ae.png)\r\n\r\nMany people seem to have the misconception that items with cursed affixes should always be worth 1 gold piece, but the logic doesn't seem to support this.

They clearly intended to set the durability to 6 instead. The same bug appeared on Split Skull Shield in the demo, which they fixed by using 15 instead (6 would be too low).\r\n- **Hammer of Jholm**: It has +4-10% (varies) enhanced damage. This has no effect on the weapon since it is too low, but the unique item has a qlvl of 1. It seems more likely they meant to set the actual damage to 4-10 to make it weaker, but since mauls don't drop from level 1 monsters, it makes it useless. (Hence the reason this item has weak stats)\r\n- **Stormshield**: It's missing the lightning resist (in both demo+Diablo 2). They removed it to use the slot for changing the graphic.","I found an exploit created by the negative stat shrines. First, let's lay down a few rules:\r\n- Ornate, Sacred, and Fascinating shrines reduce mana by 10%. Sets mana to 0 if negative.\r\n- Mysterious shrine and Tear fountain remove 1 to a random stat.\r\n- When game saves, stat values are stored as unsigned.\r\n\r\nThis trick works best with a level 1 Warrior. If you hit enough shrines to get your magic reduced to -1, then start a new game, it will be 255 since the value is unsigned. If you click any item it will refresh back to 50 however. The idea is you get a bunch of books for spells you cannot learn, get your magic down to -1, make a new game and use the books as this will not reset the stat. You then have to reduce your magic all over again back to 0 this time, hit the shrines to set your mana to zero, then drink elixirs to get mana again.\r\n\r\nFor strength and dexterity which don't have stat effects, it works even better. On a level 1 warrior, you could save/load before the random stat shrines and keep hitting until you get them to -1, make a new game, then they will be maxed out!","There is formula for the damage of Guardian which is not being used and the damage of Firebolt is used instead:\r\nhttps://github.com/diasurgical/devilution/blob/50c9b533cf949e7a8e7cc61bdc539a8d60c19a4c/Source/missiles.cpp#L2772","The hit detection to determine which area of the inventory (or belt) is under the mouse cursor doesn't align with the panel graphics particularly well.\r\n\r\nIn the following image the green areas are base hit regions, depending on the action being performed an extra line of pixels above (and sometimes to the right) of these areas is also included.\r\n![2023-03-25T154617_devilutionx_markup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/357684/227701879-db6ba8d7-5ca9-465f-b0d6-2a0301eec0ed.png)\r\n\r\nUsing the left ring slot as an example rings are drawn as a 28x28 pixel sprite with the lower left corner at (48, 205) relative to the top left corner of the panel. The hit area is a 28x29 (when pasting an item) or 29x29 (when picking up an item) region with the lower left corner at (45, 205). The area inside the golden border visible in the panel UI is 28x29 pixels with the lower left corner at (47, 206).\r\n\r\nThe gap between columns in the left/right hand slots means that it's possible to pick up a weapon/shield and not be able to place it back down again unless you move the mouse one pixel left or right. This also happens with the gutters between columns of the inventory for items two tiles wide.","Click an NPC, while walking to them click and hold down the inv button. Once the NPC interaction starts let go of the inv button.\r\nYou will now have an unresponsive inventory UI on top of the NPC UI.","Rampant use of `SetRndSeed()` using the absolute value of RNG state breaks the flow of the RNG sequence and screws up the uniformity of the random number generator. You can see this demonstrated in Griswold's premium item generation algorithm. We discovered a rather small closed loop in that algorithm that produces just ten Hellfire items. By seeding the RNG just right and carrying a bunch of expensive gear in your inventory, you can force the shop to display the same item in every one of the shop's slots.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9203145/236270666-b70644e6-48f7-4bad-a118-a5caaf23ffdf.png)\r\n\r\nThe attached file below contains debug output where I traced the calls to the RNG functions in DevilutionX. The functions in DevilutionX are more or less just renamed from the original functions in Devilution.\r\n\r\n* `AdvanceRndSeed()` = `GetRndSeed()`\r\n* `SetRndSeed()` = `SetRndSeed()`\r\n* `GenerateRnd()` = `random_()`\r\n\r\n[hellfire-rng-closed-loop.txt](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution/files/11399512/hellfire-rng-closed-loop.txt)\r\n\r\nThe most obvious solution to this would be to use the unmodified RNG state when capturing a seed to be used later. However, it would also make some sense to implement the ability to instance the RNG so you can generate a specific item or object's random number sequence without disturbing the random number sequence of, say, the RNG used for game mechanics.","Because the game captures random numbers to be used later as seeds for the RNG, it's possible for two chests on the same dungeon level to produce duplicate items. The conditions for the simplest and most likely way for this to happen are outlined below.\r\n\r\n* The chest must drop at least two items.\r\n* The next chest that was placed must drop at least one item.\r\n* The RNG state must have been a positive integer when capturing the seed for the chest object.\r\n* The RNG state must have been a positive integer when capturing the seed for the next chest object that was placed.\r\n* The RNG state must be a positive integer when capturing the seed for the first item from the chest.\r\n* The \"RNG distance\" between the chest's seed and the next chest's seed must be the same as the number of random numbers used to generate the first item.\r\n\r\nIf the stars align, RNG state after generating the chest's first item will be identical to the seed for the chest that was placed after it. I captured the following output from Devilution using `glSeedTbl[1] = 312` and opening the chests at `object[87]` and `object[86]`. In this example, the game had generated a duplicate gold pile with seed `1292792715`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperating chest 87\r\nSetRndSeed(-1271890865 -> 23863461)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(23863461 -> 1549207594)\r\nrandom_(15) >> GetRndSeed(1549207594 -> -1421509453)\r\nGetRndSeed(-1421509453 -> 726620944) returns 726620944\r\nSetRndSeed(726620944 -> 726620944)\r\nrandom_(1) >> GetRndSeed(726620944 -> 952941137)\r\nrandom_(10) >> GetRndSeed(952941137 -> -190758714)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(-190758714 -> 1387969791)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(1387969791 -> 1994707660)\r\n[CreateRndItem] Gold (726620944)\r\n\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(1994707660 -> 1028770877)\r\nrandom_(15) >> GetRndSeed(1028770877 -> -1466179934)\r\nGetRndSeed(-1466179934 -> 1292792715) returns 1292792715\r\nSetRndSeed(1292792715 -> 1292792715)\r\nrandom_(1) >> GetRndSeed(1292792715 -> -2062531128)\r\nrandom_(10) >> GetRndSeed(-2062531128 -> -772709783)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(-772709783 -> 81747390)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(81747390 -> -1013298089)\r\n[CreateRndItem] Gold (1292792715)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperating chest 86\r\nSetRndSeed(-1013298089 -> 1994707660)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(1994707660 -> 1028770877)\r\nrandom_(15) >> GetRndSeed(1028770877 -> -1466179934)\r\nGetRndSeed(-1466179934 -> 1292792715) returns 1292792715\r\nSetRndSeed(1292792715 -> 1292792715)\r\nrandom_(1) >> GetRndSeed(1292792715 -> -2062531128)\r\nrandom_(10) >> GetRndSeed(-2062531128 -> -772709783)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(-772709783 -> 81747390)\r\nrandom_(100) >> GetRndSeed(81747390 -> -1013298089)\r\n[CreateRndItem] Gold (1292792715)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe in this case, the safest solution would be to \"create space\" in the random number sequence by burning random numbers after capturing the object seed. The number of random numbers burned should be determined based on the expected number of random numbers it would take to generate the items from the chest.

That function is decorated with `_propagate_cosmo_array_attributes_to_result`, which tries to copy attributes of the first positional argument. If `coordinates` is passed as a kwarg it doesn't appear in `*args` and the decorator raises a fairly cryptic exception. I think that a sensible solution would be to use `/` in the function signature of functions that use this kind of decorator (there are a few similar ones in the `cosmo_array` related code) to enforce positional arguments be passed as positional. I think that in that case trying to do otherwise still raises an exception, but with a clear message for the user.

I stumbled apon you guys and I been looking at you work for a good 2-3hr straight tryna make sense of it, I've been going thru your code and selecting the blue highlighted words (idk what it was like your readme codes, NDK, xHook, at, and boardwalks and libraries etc..)  I went thru some of your code trying to see what this tool will be able to do n it got me excited!  (I even went to ForgeCurser.com and Android Developer trying to see what all the issues you're having... Gods speed you're doing something very amazing)\r\nBut if your making a tool for Android to make it be able to use Java tools? That's Right, right? Lol Sorry new 2 code but I love it how u make things outta random letters etc.\r\n(I use to make mod menus for Cod4, mw2 and Mw3 on my regular non jailbroken ps3 just had a USB n little pc size of my right hand(*Im 23 now*) then I got a Dex n could do anything with a Dex ps3.. sold accounts and bought my online brother a Rex Ps3 so we do anything lol.. So fun to code cus u can throw a little code n will let u do whatever.. but the best part of coding for myself was to watch your work turn into something from nothing..) but 1mod menu would take me a whole week for 3-4 pages of code for the ps3s way too much code n had to keep testing to see if it would even worked ughh. N Dex saved so much time live edit code etc no USB jus live updates. (( Sry for rambling.. I promise I'm trying to say I've been wanting a tool like this 1 for years now n glad to see your still working on it))\r\n\r\nBut if u are making an Android pe tool to use PC Java tools I really hope you and your team can add in World Paint to this app or something least similar (where u can build your world totally custom) Bcus the Mcpe Maps suck horribly they're always like repeating the same messed up chunk over n over..
